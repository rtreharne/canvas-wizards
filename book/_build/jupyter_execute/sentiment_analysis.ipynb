    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool will perform an analysis of feedback on submissions for a given (or multiple) assignments. \n",
    "\n",
    "A sentiment analysis is performed to determine sentiment score for each comment, i.e. a relative measure of how positive/negative the overall language in each comment is.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *Feedback Rating* score for each comment is calculated as the product of comment length (number of words) and sentiment score.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Video Walkthrough\n",

    "https://liverpool.instructuremedia.com/embed/e07eec3c-06e7-4ffc-872d-9d9afaf3396f\n",
    "\n",
    "## Warning\n",
    "\n",
    "There is likely to be a high level of subjectivity in the sentiment analysis and a manual audit, to compare feedback comments and corresponding sentiment scores, should be made before drawing any conclusions from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, this analysis only looks at comments made in the \"comments box\" on Speedgrader. It does not consider in-line comments/annotations made directly on the submitted documents.\n",

In this essay, you appeared to decide early on which side your views fell on, and the remainder of the essay provided (very well written) justification.

           "I enjoyed reading this essay. Well done. I thought the second paragraph made a better introduction than the first. The first was a little vague and broad but the importance was much clearer by the second paragraph. I liked the section on why animal models are used and an example of where this has not worked. It would be stronger if the example was pathogen-related and you expanded the scientific detail of why these models are inaccurate. Try to avoid confusing some key terms and also drifting too much into therapeutics. While this is a really important aspect, the question actually asks about testing pathogen virulence. Make sure you answer this question. What is virulence. How is it measured. You could also display your depth of knowledge by covering what human challenge models are available. This would make a good figure and would certainly be a way to gain higher marks. You touched a a little on using health volunteers and mentioned a specific patient group. This was a missed opportunity to discuss whether healthy volunteers may be representatiev of at-risk groups. You can also strengthen your writing by referring to codes of ethics. Why do they exist and what do we have to adhere to? What would be considered ethicala nd what wouldn't. Overall your scientific writing style is good and you used some really good supplementary material."

You should be looking towards mostly scientific articles and only websites like that if it's really necessary. You also have a tendency to slip into unscientific language. I have noted this in the in text comments. Try to use specific examples, particularly if you say things like \"in the experiment\", make it clear what teh experiment was and why it was important. When you include an in text citation, do not put a full stop before it. Put it with the sentence it belongs with. Make sure you fully explain concepts and other things that you refer to. For example, what is the Nuremburg code and why is it important. Don't be afraid to highlight the complexity of the topic. You finish off by saying the using human volunteers to study virulence is ethical. But really it's more complex than that. If it's a pathogen with a really high mortality rate and no treatment then it really wouldn't. To gain higher marks you could also use a figure. One highlighting the different challenge models would really work here."

Arguments focussed mainly on crop production and human health, but also briefly on ecosystems and the economic impact. My major comment is that the arguments were quite mixed about the pros and cons related to honeybee extinction, and comments about self-pollinating crops or pollinators and human interventions (not identified in any detail) could negate this. Therefore, it wasn't clear what conclusions were to be drawn until the very end. In that sense, the synthesis and evaluation could have been improved."

Most of all, you could have (a) done more to explain the criteria you and others use to evaluate ethical considerations, and (b) provided a few more examples of where human infection has been used to study pathogens. You give only the example of TGN1412 (not a pathogen) and SARS-CoV-2 (where you don't really explain how controlled infections might be used). There are numerous other examples which span the whole spectrum from largely ethical to extremely unethical (and verging on crimes against humanity).

FOr higher marks, you could clarify the structure and make the text more concise, while thinking more about the assumptions in the question.\n\nKnowledge: mainly fine but a few factual errors, e.g. malaria affects the Northern hemisphere just as much as the Southern (west Africa, indian subcontinent). Teh relevance of the vaccine section (which are not drugs) is not made relevant to the question.\n\nComprehension: good understanding throughout.\n\nSynthesis: you could make the points linking the paragraphs together stronger, its not entirely clear whether you think insecticides and drugs have been successful or not. You have a reasonable conclusion, uses vaccines instead of either insectides or therapeutic drugs, but you need to state what weakness they share that vaccines overcome. A critical comparison of the factors affecting their use/abuse would be welcome (both need epidemiological information, strategy depends on context and on infrastructure).\n\nRemember, you have to answer the question, but you don't have to accept its assumptions (i.e. that it must be either/or, or that they are fundamentally different, or that there is a single answer)\n\nStructure: good but paragraphs too long? I would split them into history/method and then critical assessment of their success. You have brought new information into the  conclusion, and some is inconsistent with the body (i.e. effect of hazing on children given as principal drawback of insecticides but elsewhere you say that \"All four classes \nare safe to be used in indoor replant sprays (IRS))\". This is confusing, especially in the conclusion.\n\nSupplementary: good use of supp to provide stats as evidence.\n\nLanguage: good to explain things in simple terms, but be concise."

I thought the historical context worked well to really highlight the questionable ethical background of the area.\nThe main part of the essay was heavily skewed towards SARS-CoV2 and this could have been balanced with some examples of the different human challange models available. This would work well as a figure or a table. The vaccine figure you used could have been made more relevant by ensuring it came back to human volunteer models. The section that discussed the poor representation of certain key groups was great. This would be made even stronger by the use of more examples where virulence differs. \nThe argument about models (either animals or in vitro) was great and would be further strengthened by using examples of disease relevant models. To gain higher marks, you could include a critiqu of these. In many cases, animal or in vitro models do exist but they often fail to recapitulate the human environment. This could also be an argument for using human volunteers. \nYour use of supplementary material was excellent.\nOverall, this was a really good essay that was enjoyable to read. To gain higher marks, include further critique and enure that text is supported by hard facts and figures from published data. Display your depth of knowledge by providing lots of examples early on, even if you go on to focus on a single example in depth. Well done."

In this case you have simply placed links in the text and this is not the format we accept. A proper scientific reference should be formatted in text as (Author Date). For example I would cite your essay using the following citation (Thatcher 2022) in text and then more complete details in the reference list. Furthermore, the sources you have chosen look like good sources for research but not for citing in an essay. The overwhelming majority of your references in an essay need to be primary literature sources like scientific papers or the occasional textbook.\n\nMore generally, you raise some very good points in this essay and approach the rather frightening claims made with a healthy sense of skepticism. This is very good. Keep that critical thinking active at all times when you're presented with a claim like this. What I would like to see for some of the higher marks is you fully developing these points. You could discuss these in some more detail. For example, your point about economic strife cause by bee extinction is good but you could go on to explain that civilisational struggle and even collapse is not quite extinction. You get close to this point but don't quite explain it. As a note this is hard with short word counts so you've still raised some good issues here.\n\nAnother problem (and this is common to all student essays) is that sometimes you lose track of what you're saying and your sentence doesn't make sense. This is hard to solve when typing but can be addressed by proofreading. Most people struggle to proofread their own text so you may want to enlist a friend or family member. Alternatively, a good trick is to proofread your own text backwards, paragraph by paragraph. this should allow you to think about each paragraph (starting with the last) and whether it all hangs together and makes sense on its own. Try it. I promise you'll be impressed with how helpful it can be.\n\nOverall, although you may be disappointed with the mark here, you're actually not far from a much higher one if you solve some of the more fiddly problems like referencing. So don't get disheartened."

However, the essay was quite hard to follow as you repeatedly used sweeping generalisations with little evidence to back this up. You could include examples of recent human volunteer models (there are quite a few across viruses and bacteria). The reference to ethics committees showed some understanding of the processes involved but there as no detail. A scientific essay should include data from published studies. You could include a figure or a table (perhaps one that showed recently used models). Try to be critical - there may be scenarios in which these approaches are ethical and scenarios where they are not. What about disease severity? (like healthy volunteers and SARS-CoV2) Should there be available treatments? (like some of the Streptococcus pneumoniae models). What are the alternatives? Do these have key limitations? If you ask yourself some clear questions, this will help you structure your essay. Using examples shows the reader that you have a depth of knowledge. Using specific language rather than sweeping generalisations shows you have deep comprehension. These essays don't have a clear right or wrong answer.

You need to make more points as you move through the argument; you cannot assume that the reader will draw any conclusions from the material presented.\n\nStructure: sensible but more consolidation is needed, you need to include linker sentences to explain why one paragraph is followed by the next.

           "Some additional feedback:\nKnowledge base and relevance: \nStrictly speaking, some of what you have written is not directly relevant to the question. For example, where you talk about wasps: ‘They are excellent predators of a variety of major crop pests, such as aphids. Their exploitative associations  have  shaped  the  evolution  of  invertebrates,  maintaining  balance  and  biodiversity.’  Although interesting, it is not directly relevant to the question. \nAnother example: ‘But in a world without the hatred to wasps, only imagine the possibilities.’ Here, it is not clear how this contributes to answering the question (at least not without going into more detail).\nAnd another: ‘Species  like  the  grassland  butterfly  have  decreased  by  25%  in  the  most  stable  regions. Additionally, a single year of drought in 1976 caused butterfly species to fall by 76% in the UK (Ritchie,  2021)’ Is this relevant? If it is, you need to explain how.\nIn terms of knowledge: as per my text comment, it would be good to include a definition of 'honeybee'. What species are we talking about? (scientific name, taxon) Also, you may want to include a similar kind of information as you provide for the wasp: what is the importance of honeybees etc.\nStructure:\nI would advise against using short-ish paragraphs, this makes the essay slightly disjointed. Try to aim for three main paragraphs in a 1000 word essay (in addition to intro and conclusion). Each or the main paragraphs should have an overarching theme – you can test this by trying to find a ‘heading’ for each paragraph (I don’t recommend actually using sub-headings in your final essay but it’s a useful exercise)\n\nHope this helps."

Can I make that point clearer? 4) use spell check and grammar check functions of Word.\n\nThe order/structure of your essay isn't bad....but the idea of why the honeybee might go extinct is not covered well. Each paragraph doesn't really develop and cover an independent idea (outside the introductory and conclusion paragraphs)."

Your introduction was about pathogens/diseases rather than the topic- introduce the topic! You provide a descriptive pros and cons of in vitro/in vivo/human studies, but do not really address the major issue surrounding ethics. You provide some examples- which is good, but there is so much room to discuss ethical issues regarding these examples."

You also used supplementary sources well and structured your answer nicely. In places, I thought your arguments were slightly contradictory. For example, I don't think you can apply the Trolley problem argument and also advocate for the 'do no harm' clause of the Hippocratic oath. The two will often be in direct conflict. That said, raising them both as for/against arguments is a reasonable approach to take. To improve, you could have highlighted some examples of where human challenge studies have demonstrably aided our understanding of pathogen virulence."

You presented the material that you found well, and came to a balanced conclusion based on that material. However, I think there was a bit of misconception throughout the essay as to whether race (as we understand it) has a biological basis, such that race 'per se' could affect pharmacology. Certainly medical studies have been historically biased towards white people, and I agree that this is objectionable and hampered scientific progress. But this is not because there are consistent, significant, fundamental biological differences between different races. Instead, different alleles are at different frequencies in different 'races', so focusing on one or another can exclude important aspects of human diversity that could impact treatment outcomes. I've tried to provide some references in my feedback to help with this misconception but I would be happy to chat more about it. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Some historical examples (Edward Jenner small pox vaccination) would have been superb.\n \nYou have some got basics about virulence wrong. Its not much about penetration and survival- its about harmfulness or the severity of the disease. LD50 is not just pathogens- could be anything (drug, toxin, radiation etc) and they may not necessarily be the same in rats and humans. Your example of breast cancer trial isn't relevant. Was a pathogen involved there? I believe it was a therapeutic reagent trial- not admissible in this context. \n\nIt wouldn't be ethically favourable to endanger human lives.

           "Hi Luca,\nThis is a fair attempt at the essay topic and is largely well written. However, its quite disjointed and could have flowed better. The main issue however is your referencing and sources of material, you rely on a few sources and whilst these are legitimate sources in most cases, you should always try and use mostly primary sources of information e.g. the peer reviewed literature, furthermore you need to fully write it in your own words and not patch work text from the sources. Finally, the way you have added intext citations is incorrect and you must give a reference list. Please look at the resources in the library, such as KnowHow and CiteThemRight, as referencing as last year you also had difficulty with referencing and its a area you should really concentrate some effort on as it will hold you back from getting higher marks.  I have also put other comments in the text which I hope will be helpful for you improving your essay writing."

           "Well done. I thought the introductory paragraph was good. You attempted to explain some of the key terms and reinforce their relevance. However, there are a few broad and sweeping statements. Avoid this as they are rarely true. Use careful language based on evidence from the scientific literature. For example, is the outcome of test ever 100% definite, particulary challenge with a pathogen. Is this realistic criteria? Again, in paragraph 2 you make another sweeping statement about antibodies protecting volunteers from harm. I think you should think more about the scenarios in which a human model would be acceptable and when it wouldn't. This would show comprehension. There is little background about what ones are available. I did like the SARS-CoV2 example thought. By including this abckground, you would show a depth of knowledge. This could also be an opportunity to include a figure and add depth without adding to the word count. The historical aspect worked well but the language at times lapsed into a more informal style rather than a scientific style. Please also include a word count. See in text comments for more feedback too."

There is so much to elaborate on here. Could other animals cover for the honeybees? Could plants evolve or be manipulated by us and how much effort/money would that take?

Ultimately this kind of thing is worth very few marks (1 or 2) in most cases but since it's easy, try enlisting a friend or relative to proofread. Alternatively, proofread your own text by reading each paragraph in isolation starting from the end of the essay and working back to the start. It can be a good way to analyze your own structure.\n\nThe points you raise here are well researched and well though out. you bring in good evidence for your major claims and it really helps support the arguments you make. I would say that your conclusion surprised me. I had gathered from your main text that you were very worried about drug resistance and would prefer other methods. This is usually a sign that your weighting is a little off and maybe you could have developed your concerns about insecticides more. For example the blanket use of insecticides can be dangerous to other ecosystem components and you don't really cover this.\n\nOverall, a good essay. You are a little verbose sometimes so try going back through your text and trying to ruthlessly cut out unneeded lines or words. You might be suprised how much space you can free up. Very well done."

For higher marks, you need to think around the question, discuss some of the other factors that determine success or failure (e.g. climate change, local epidemiological factors, land use etc.). Also, remember, you have to answer the question, but you don't have to accept its assumptions (i.e. that it has to be either/or, or that they are fundamentally different, or that there is a single answer). Challenging these assumptions is a good way to demonstrate critical thinking.\n\nStructure: very sensible and easy to follow.\n\nSupplementary: good use of citations to support statistics.\n\nLanguage: Needs redrafting, words missing, grammar missing, to the extent that meaning is unclear in places.

This information is patchy. Similarly the argument around tomatoes and the dislodging of pollen grains.

You NEED to have an in-text reference even if you have alluded to the authors already.

You should carefully check over any written work you submit.\nYou also made errors with your referencing. in the main body of the text, you shouldn't include initials. Further, when there are multiple authors, you only cited the first author. If ther are less than three, you should cite them all, and if there are more than three you should cite the first author and use et al.

           "Title needs to stand by making it bold or put underline.\n\nReference format is different from Harvard style. For example, (Lipstick M, et. al., 2014) in the correct one. In the reference list, et. Al. should be et. al.\n\nThe first paragraph covers history of human clinical trials but does not say what the essay will discuss or highlight about. It is also important to briefly mention who is Edward Jenner and What is the Willowbrook experiment. At least references required. Don't assume readers know everything. \n\nThe second paragraph first describes problem with pathogens throughout history and then story about smallpox vaccine. The connection to the smallpox vaccine was not clear. The previous sentence says that smallpox killed lot of people in 20th century and this led to Edward's vaccine?  13 million death cause by disease but not clear how much diseases caused by pathogens?, which is the main one in the essay. \"in the 20th century\" should come after 540 million people?  This paragraph ends with stressing importance of past mistakes which lead to the next section very well.\n\nThe third paragraph started from the Declaration of Helsinki. Reference needs for this. Then example of human trials for pathogens during WWII was described. Again, the Nuremberg Code requires reference. This paragraph finishes with controlled human infection study. Good end but brief deification of \"controlled\" is necessary as it's vague. \n\nThe fourth section is not clear to me. Why human challenge studies are more ethical than normal clinical trials? No example/evidence was shown within the essay. Under 10% of malaria vaccine clinical trials will progress to phase III, so what does this means? If you want to stress that this is low rate, then better to show example with higher success rate. If stress high, then other way round. I believe that most of drug trial could be less that 10% success rate. \n\nThe conclusion is good with stating the student's own opinion. \n\nHope these helps to improve your essay or any kind of report writing. \n\nWell done."

Firstly, the formatting of paragraphs in the intro and conclusion could be improved. Secondly, and more importantly, you deviate from the question in places. The essay title asked for a specific focus on the use of HCT for study of virulence. This is distinct from vaccine studies and that distinction is important because the cost/benefit analysis when considering the ethics is difference."

Your piece is well written and well researched.\n\nThere are a lot of references (which is good) but the sources are a little suspect. There are too many news and popular science sources here. You need to be focussing on primary literature.\n\nAs for your conclusion, I think there is a slight flaw in your argument (don't worry it doesn't cost you many marks but it's important to be aware). The reduction in bee population and diversity that you point to is something that doesn't happen in isolation. It is probably not the case that all the other bees and other pollinators can chip in and cover the gap because they too are subject to the forces that are threatening bees. You slightly miss the chance to set up this point despite your good focus on non-honeybee species. I think it might change your argument if you were to consider that honeybees going extinct might be a harbinger of a more general ecological decline or even collapse. Nevertheless, your point is soundly argued that honeybees alone aren't going to finish us off.\n\nOverall a good essay with a decent structure and a well argued case. Well done."

It would be good to tell what you are going to discuss about.

           "Knowledge: mostly, you have presented a suitable range of relevant material but it is underdeveloped in several places, e.g. your introduction claims that the infection rate has increased massively since 2020; you need to provide a citation for this because the recent global trend has been in decline. Also your description of drug administration is not detailed enough. The sections on vaccines and diagnoses are not made relevant to the question - they might be relevant but you have say how. \n\nComprehension: there are few places where inaccuracies suggest that you don't entirely understand, e.g. drug resistance is not found only in Africa but worldwide. There are inconsistencies or contradictions between your text and your table, e.g. you say there are \"no serious human and environmental health effects\" of insecticides but also that they can \"harm humans\" in the text.\n\n\nSynthesis: it is sometimes unclear why the argument takes the course it does because you have not finished each paragraph by making a point. Without these statements, the text becomes a list of facts, from which the reader is supposed to draw their own conclusion, and that won't always be what you intend. Your conclusion is too long given the shortness of the essay altogether. You present a sound argument, and I like the way you show the importance of a third factor (epidemiological surveillance) to the success or failure of both treatment approaches. This shows criticial thinking, but you could make the point more forcefully, i.e. say that neither approach can be successful without understanding the epidemiological context. draw out the factors that make both solutions succeed or fail, like epidemiological surveillance.\n\nStructure: Sensible layout, but lack of joining sentences means that the progression of argument is haphazard - e.g. transition into Figure 1 discussion - how does this relate to the preceeding paragraph? The table is a good idea, but you need to write about it in the text.\n\nSupplementary: citations are thin generally, but good use of the DDT resistance study - for more marks explain how representative this is of the current situation.\n\nLanguage: put species names in Italics and give the full name on first use.\nGenerally, some redrafting was needed because some prose is awkward, e.g. \"There have been instances where insecticides have been known to not control the presence of malaria due to resistance, however, there is nothing to prove that this is the case and is thereby, still used as a controlling measure.\" Aside from the grammatical errors, its not clear why something that is 'known' is discarded as unproven."

Some small issues with structuring; 1) The introduction doesnt need all that detail in the middle, just explore malaria, its significance, and the control methods to be discussed in general. 2) In the main body, try and keep each point to be discussed together (see comments). The conclusion would have benefited from a final comparison of the two, some limitations and then the best control methods from everything you've presented. All in all a good job!"

If you had access to only one, which would it be?

So it should be written as \"Industrialisation\". \n\nThe first paragraph clearly states what the essay will discuss about. This is very good. \n\nIn the second paragraph, it was mentioned that climate change has reduced the water cleanliness, causing a problem for people who make their lives from farmland. This is good point but never discussed later, how genetically modified organisms can help solving this problem. This section ends with potential of genetically modified crops for climate change. \n\nThe third paragraph is very well written and discussed how genetically modified plants are useful to control carbon dioxide. \n\nThe fourth paragraph is not quite clear to me. Genetic improvement of what? for some traits, which traits? More specificity required. \n\nIn the fifth paragraph, interesting topic was discussed. The resurrection of extinct species in the context of climate change is interesting. Ethical issue for this topic was also considered, which I think very good. It would be even better if the essay mentions about why and how re-establishing the interactions between species and environment before the mammoths disappeared give the current ecosystem chance to recover? \n\nThe conclusion is impressive.

Some improvements could be made in the figure sizes as well as the legends. Whilst a deep understanding of the content is shown, there could be some improvement in translating the points into well balanced and thought out arguments. Language is entirely acceptable and academic, however, in some places can be 'wordy' and cumbersome to read. Overall a great attempt though!"

You made good points, and provided good evidence and evaluation, well structured in that way. Some structure issues with a risk in the benefit section. Try to keep one large main body section for each point: benefits and risks. Your conclusion seemed rushed, especially compared to the quality of your introduction. Your font is taking up too much space, and makes your reference list look very messy. See notes on essay for detailed feedback, all in all a great job here!"

You English is sound although contains some grammatical errors and a few areas where I'm not sure whether your essay is written as intended but it will likely improve with the fullness of time.  Try to ensure that each paragraph you use has an introductory sentence and a concluding sentence and each covers a slightly different angle of the argument you are trying to present.  Also consider using headings for different sections of your essay to help guide the reader to the aspect of the topic you are about to discuss.  Some discussion about benefits and risks to the individual and how they might differ to the whole population may also strengthen some of the points you mention.  Could these studies be replaced by animal studies or cell line/in vitro studies? If not, why not? Are there any examples from the literature where animal infection studies don't give the same response as human volunteer studies?"

However, I think that the essay lacked a strong structure, and some of the papers that you used and included were not relevant to the subject, or not well organised in the essay. Next time, try harder to think about exactly what the main point of every paragraph is and then only use those articles which are directly linked to the point. There are a couple of other comments on the document about improving the introduction and conclusion. Overall, I think that you have a good understanding of the subject and the importance of including precise scientific detail. Now, you should try to work on essay structure and logical flow more."

There was also very good use of figures and statistics to support the essay. A major comment to improve the essay would be around structure and layout.

Citation and referencing is incorrect, and the use of three references is not enough.

Well done. I thought the second paragraph made a better introduction than the first. The first was a little vague and broad but the importance was much clearer by the second paragraph. I liked the section on why animal models are used and an example of where this has not worked. It would be stronger if the example was pathogen-related and you expanded the scientific detail of why these models are inaccurate. Try to avoid confusing some key terms and also drifting too much into therapeutics. While this is a really important aspect, the question actually asks about testing pathogen virulence. Make sure you answer this question. What is virulence. How is it measured. You could also display your depth of knowledge by covering what human challenge models are available. This would make a good figure and would certainly be a way to gain higher marks. You touched a a little on using health volunteers and mentioned a specific patient group. This was a missed opportunity to discuss whether healthy volunteers may be representatiev of at-risk groups. You can also strengthen your writing by referring to codes of ethics. Why do they exist and what do we have to adhere to? What would be considered ethicala nd what wouldn't.

I liked the opening sentence which immediately put the topic into a historial context. Try not to use references from websites. You should be looking towards mostly scientific articles and only websites like that if it's really necessary. You also have a tendency to slip into unscientific language. I have noted this in the in text comments. Try to use specific examples, particularly if you say things like \\\"in the experiment\\\", make it clear what teh experiment was and why it was important. When you include an in text citation, do not put a full stop before it. Put it with the sentence it belongs with. Make sure you fully explain concepts and other things that you refer to. For example, what is the Nuremburg code and why is it important. Don't be afraid to highlight the complexity of the topic. You finish off by saying the using human volunteers to study virulence is ethical. But really it's more complex than that. If it's a pathogen with a really high mortality rate and no treatment then it really wouldn't. To gain higher marks you could also use a figure.

Arguments focussed mainly on crop production and human health, but also briefly on ecosystems and the economic impact. My major comment is that the arguments were quite mixed about the pros and cons related to honeybee extinction, and comments about self-pollinating crops or pollinators and human interventions (not identified in any detail) could negate this.

A good rule of thumb is that whenever you are stating something like X% of crops are animal pollinated (ie there is a number involved) or a study was done to show, you should link the information to a citation. Sometimes you do exactly this and there's no problem but sometimes it is missing and becomes more noticeable by it's absence.\\n\\nOccasionally, you bring up a point (such as the economic costs of losing bees) and fail to develop it much further.

Most of all, you could have (a) done more to explain the criteria you and others use to evaluate ethical considerations, and (b) provided a few more examples of where human infection has been used to study pathogens. You give only the example of TGN1412 (not a pathogen) and SARS-CoV-2 (where you don't really explain how controlled infections might be used). There are numerous other examples which span the whole spectrum from largely ethical to extremely unethical (and verging on crimes against humanity).

The most important was the use of dubious sources of secondary information on the safety of GM food. This is an old chestnut with no scientific evidence to support harm. But even if there was such evidence, its relevance to this essay is questionable as you are supposed to be weighing-up the evidence for GM organisms helping in the fight against climate change, not so much on potential safety concerns. Most of your other sources, including those for the use of GM, were not primary research articles nor even peer-reviewed secondary sources (review articles).

There are some things that hold you back though.\\n\\nThe biggest and most obvious is referencing. In this case you have simply placed links in the text and this is not the format we accept. A proper scientific reference should be formatted in text as (Author Date). For example I would cite your essay using the following citation (Thatcher 2022) in text and then more complete details in the reference list. Furthermore, the sources you have chosen look like good sources for research but not for citing in an essay. The overwhelming majority of your references in an essay need to be primary literature sources like scientific papers or the occasional textbook.\\n\\nMore generally, you raise some very good points in this essay and approach the rather frightening claims made with a healthy sense of skepticism. This is very good. Keep that critical thinking active at all times when you're presented with a claim like this. What I would like to see for some of the higher marks is you fully developing these points. You could discuss these in some more detail. For example, your point about economic strife cause by bee extinction is good but you could go on to explain that civilisational struggle and even collapse is not quite extinction. You get close to this point but don't quite explain it. As a note this is hard with short word counts so you've still raised some good issues here.\\n\\nAnother problem (and this is common to all student essays) is that sometimes you lose track of what you're saying and your sentence doesn't make sense. This is hard to solve when typing but can be addressed by proofreading. Most people struggle to proofread their own text so you may want to enlist a friend or family member. Alternatively, a good trick is to proofread your own text backwards, paragraph by paragraph. this should allow you to think about each paragraph (starting with the last) and whether it all hangs together and makes sense on its own. Try it. I promise you'll be impressed with how helpful it can be.\\n\\nOverall, although you may be disappointed with the mark here, you're actually not far from a much higher one if you solve some of the more fiddly problems like referencing. So don't get disheartened.\"],[\"Christopher Mitchell\",42,-0.15,\"As a note, late penalties are applied automatically now but don't worry, I've added your name to a list so it will be removed.

However, the essay was quite hard to follow as you repeatedly used sweeping generalisations with little evidence to back this up. You could include examples of recent human volunteer models (there are quite a few across viruses and bacteria). The reference to ethics committees showed some understanding of the processes involved but there as no detail. A scientific essay should include data from published studies. You could include a figure or a table (perhaps one that showed recently used models). Try to be critical - there may be scenarios in which these approaches are ethical and scenarios where they are not. What about disease severity? (like healthy volunteers and SARS-CoV2) Should there be available treatments? (like some of the Streptococcus pneumoniae models). What are the alternatives? Do these have key limitations? If you ask yourself some clear questions, this will help you structure your essay. Using examples shows the reader that you have a depth of knowledge. Using specific language rather than sweeping generalisations shows you have deep comprehension. These essays don't have a clear right or wrong answer.

This is a good way to start. Be careful about using very general statements.

I liked the reference to the historical background, Nuremberg code and Helsinki Declaration however, try to be specific about why these are important. At times, your style of writing is very chatty rather than being written with a scientific style. Make sure your references are primary references, particularly when referring to things like clinical trials. To gain higher marks, make your understanding of the topic clear by using very specific examples. For example, you stated that animal models can't be used because viruses are specific. This is such a broad statement that it becomes untrue. Hwoever, you could have found examples of where animal models have not been developed or where data fron animal models translated poorly into humans. You could pick out specific examples of how the immune system differs. By doing this, you are taking a scientific approach. You are using the scientific literature to build an argument.

Some of the generic points you make may be better placed in the introduction section to your report in the second paragraph to introduce the ethical isssues prior to showing several examples for/against reliability of human vs animal studies for instance and then drawing all of this together in a conclusion to state whether the benefits outweigh the risks and whether ethical considerations are appropriate or full ethical studies could ever be achieved.\"],[\"Amy Chadwick\",124,0.33571428571428574,\"Georgia, I enjoyed reading you essay which presented good arguments for and against the thesis - with a strong final conclusion.

This can be difficult with limited word counts but it is a skill worth developing. For example, you raise some points that seem to just hang alone rather than connect to your central point. You mention vitamin A and leafcutter bees working close to the nest but don't explain why these points are important. For the very highest marks, you'll need to develop these ideas fully.\\n\\nI should add that the fourth paragraph does an excellent job of doing this. It is fully developed, brings in important evidence and makes a good argument. That should be a model for your writing in future. It's excellent.\\n\\nOverall, good work. Well done.\"],[\"Liam Dougherty\",90,0.22307692307692306,\"This is a really good issue which discusses a complicated issue in a considered and clear way.

Some historical examples (Edward Jenner small pox vaccination) would have been superb.\\n \\nYou have some got basics about virulence wrong. Its not much about penetration and survival- its about harmfulness or the severity of the disease. LD50 is not just pathogens- could be anything (drug, toxin, radiation etc) and they may not necessarily be the same in rats and humans. Your example of breast cancer trial isn't relevant. Was a pathogen involved there? I believe it was a therapeutic reagent trial- not admissible in this context. \\n\\nIt wouldn't be ethically favourable to endanger human lives.

However, its quite disjointed and could have flowed better. The main issue however is your referencing and sources of material, you rely on a few sources and whilst these are legitimate sources in most cases, you should always try and use mostly primary sources of information e.g. the peer reviewed literature, furthermore you need to fully write it in your own words and not patch work text from the sources. Finally, the way you have added intext citations is incorrect and you must give a reference list. Please look at the resources in the library, such as KnowHow and CiteThemRight, as referencing as last year you also had difficulty with referencing and its a area you should really concentrate some effort on as it will hold you back from getting higher marks.

You attempted to explain some of the key terms and reinforce their relevance. However, there are a few broad and sweeping statements. Avoid this as they are rarely true. Use careful language based on evidence from the scientific literature. For example, is the outcome of test ever 100% definite, particulary challenge with a pathogen. Is this realistic criteria? Again, in paragraph 2 you make another sweeping statement about antibodies protecting volunteers from harm. I think you should think more about the scenarios in which a human model would be acceptable and when it wouldn't. This would show comprehension. There is little background about what ones are available. I did like the SARS-CoV2 example thought. By including this abckground, you would show a depth of knowledge.

Then example of human trials for pathogens during WWII was described. Again, the Nuremberg Code requires reference. This paragraph finishes with controlled human infection study. Good end but brief deification of \\\"controlled\\\" is necessary as it's vague. \\n\\nThe fourth section is not clear to me. Why human challenge studies are more ethical than normal clinical trials? No example/evidence was shown within the essay. Under 10% of malaria vaccine clinical trials will progress to phase III, so what does this means? If you want to stress that this is low rate, then better to show example with higher success rate. If stress high, then other way round. I believe that most of drug trial could be less that 10% success rate. \\n\\nThe conclusion is good with stating the student's own opinion. \\n\\nHope these helps to improve your essay or any kind of report writing. \\n\\nWell done.\"],[\"Daniel Neill\",90,0.3394444444444444,\"Lots of good stuff here Kerry. Excellent use of supplementary resources and I like the way you formulate your argument. Two things knocked your mark down a bit. Firstly, the formatting of paragraphs in the intro and conclusion could be improved. Secondly, and more importantly, you deviate from the question in places. The essay title asked for a specific focus on the use of HCT for study of virulence. This is distinct from vaccine studies and that distinction is important because the cost/benefit analysis when considering the ethics is difference.\"],[\"Christopher Mitchell\",217,0.26458333333333334,\"A good essay bringing in some excellent points and making a solid, consistent argument throughout. Your piece is well written and well researched.\\n\\nThere are a lot of references (which is good) but the sources are a little suspect. There are too many news and popular science sources here. You need to be focussing on primary literature.\\n\\nAs for your conclusion, I think there is a slight flaw in your argument (don't worry it doesn't cost you many marks but it's important to be aware). The reduction in bee population and diversity that you point to is something that doesn't happen in isolation. It is probably not the case that all the other bees and other pollinators can chip in and cover the gap because they too are subject to the forces that are threatening bees. You slightly miss the chance to set up this point despite your good focus on non-honeybee species. I think it might change your argument if you were to consider that honeybees going extinct might be a harbinger of a more general ecological decline or even collapse. Nevertheless, your point is soundly argued that honeybees alone aren't going to finish us off.\\n\\nOverall a good essay with a decent structure and a well argued case. Well done.\"],[\"Kazuhiro Yamamoto\",209,0.1753968253968254,\"Nice idea to provide heading for each paragraph. \\n\\nThere were some mistype, formatting error (indentation, extra space etc) and too long sentences for readers to understand easily. These should be considered to improve your essay or any form of report. \\n\\nThe first paragraph gives background of pathogens in general and human infection studies. It would be good to tell what you are going to discuss about. For example, you can say that in this essay I will introduce example cases for controlled and uncontrolled human infection (CHI) studies and discuss about its future. Also, it is important to define what is the \\\"controlled\\\" human infection study as control means a lot.\\n\\nThe second paragraph listed up a few cases for CHI studies. Important studies were introduced. \\\"A CHI study is also much cheaper model...\\\" Cheaper than which model? \\n\\nThe third paragraph tells about the case against controlled human infections study. I would separate paragraph from \\\"Legislation\\\" and put heading for the paragraph. Also, the essay should have the final conclusive section in the separate paragraph.\\n\\nTowards the end of essay, you clearly stated your opinion based on what you discussed within the essay, which is great.  \\n\\nPlease find the comments embedded within the essay. \\n\\nHope these helps.

Also your description of drug administration is not detailed enough. The sections on vaccines and diagnoses are not made relevant to the question - they might be relevant but you have say how. \\n\\nComprehension: there are few places where inaccuracies suggest that you don't entirely understand, e.g. drug resistance is not found only in Africa but worldwide. There are inconsistencies or contradictions between your text and your table, e.g. you say there are \\\"no serious human and environmental health effects\\\" of insecticides but also that they can \\\"harm humans\\\" in the text.\\n\\n\\nSynthesis: it is sometimes unclear why the argument takes the course it does because you have not finished each paragraph by making a point. Without these statements, the text becomes a list of facts, from which the reader is supposed to draw their own conclusion, and that won't always be what you intend. Your conclusion is too long given the shortness of the essay altogether. You present a sound argument, and I like the way you show the importance of a third factor (epidemiological surveillance) to the success or failure of both treatment approaches. This shows criticial thinking, but you could make the point more forcefully, i.e. say that neither approach can be successful without understanding the epidemiological context. draw out the factors that make both solutions succeed or fail, like epidemiological surveillance.\\n\\nStructure: Sensible layout, but lack of joining sentences means that the progression of argument is haphazard - e.g. transition into Figure 1 discussion - how does this relate to the preceeding paragraph? The table is a good idea, but you need to write about it in the text.\\n\\nSupplementary: citations are thin generally, but good use of the DDT resistance study - for more marks explain how representative this is of the current situation.\\n\\nLanguage: put species names in Italics and give the full name on first use.\\nGenerally, some redrafting was needed because some prose is awkward, e.g. \\\"There have been instances where insecticides have been known to not control the presence of malaria due to resistance, however, there is nothing to prove that this is the case and is thereby, still used as a controlling measure.\\\" Aside from the grammatical errors, its not clear why something that is 'known' is discarded as unproven.\"],[\"Marcus Blagrove\",25,0.705,\"very good content, but more discussion in the text would have improved it. instead of one-sided paragraphs, give alternatives and discuss as you go along.\"],[\"Jo Fothergill\",146,0.33828125000000003,\"Well done. This was an excellent attempt at this essay. I really enjoyed your use of examples and the way you focused on virulence. When you use examples, make sure you don't assume too much prior knowledge. For example, when you mention cagA try to explain what it is and why it's important. Try to avoid broad statements and use your specific examples. When you first use a bacterial name, write the full species name. After that, it can be shortened. To gain higher marks, you could include a figure. This is a good way of including more information without adding to the word count.

I only have two minor suggestions for improvement, one specific, one more general. Firstly, I don't think we should equate vaccine studies in humans with challenge studies that are investigating virulence.

Keep up the good work.\"],[\"Zhikai Xu\",12,0.0,\"It's a miss load of my draft, please see attempt 2\"],[\"Alan Cartmell\",61,0.11990740740740745,\"This was a good attempt. A little more detail is needed in places and you gave yourself the opportunity to do it but did not capitalise, HIV protease being the main example. The section about alphafold was a bit confused too and you may need to read into it more. Overall, not too bad. See in text comments for more detail.\"],[\"Nicola Williams\",75,0.20925000000000002,\"Well done Yishan on a very well structured and researched essay. It was very clear and you discussed the topic really well and backed up your statements and discussion with appropriate references. There were a few minor areas for improvement as indicated in the comments on the report and you could have mentioned a little more about how the drugs are used and also, brought in cost as well. Overall, you did an excellent job.\"],[\"Robert Morris\",60,0.27291666666666664,\"Good attempt. Some structure issues in your essay and sections. Keep the two arguments in different sections until the conclusion. What does all this data mean that you presented? There were also a lot of repeating. Formatting issues when using a full stop, and more published data could be included instead of news articles. Check comments attached for detailed feedback.\"],[\"Marcus Blagrove\",152,0.2613095238095238,\"Overall, you covered a wide range of points but the essay needed more specific points. e.g. many important details were not mentioned, just a field was mentioned. in other areas you discuss the biology/genetics but do not relate it to GOF. if you do this then your arguments focus more on the question and it makes the essay more focused. it also helps you to dicuss the points in relation to the question more easily.\\n\\nThe conclusion needs to be a reflection of what you have discussed in the essay rather than general points. \\n\\nTo improve I would suggest making sure that all of your points relate specifically to the question, in this case GOF. secondly, be specific when giving examnples, rather than just 'we don't know if viruses can adapt to the condition', state what conditions, give an example, and if it exists give a real-world example and reference ect.\"],[\"Bill Paxton\",29,0.6,\"I like the essay, It is well structed and written with good points argued.\\nSome more examples may help. discussing where it cannot be used ie HIV-1 research.\"],[\"Kazuhiro Yamamoto\",263,0.2361962365591398,\"The essay is well written but please consider the points below to improve your essay and any report writing. \\n\\nThe title can be bold or with underline to stand out. \\n\\nIndustrialization is American English. As long as consistent in the essay it is not major issue but I would recommend you to use British as we are in UK. So it should be written as \\\"Industrialisation\\\". \\n\\nThe first paragraph clearly states what the essay will discuss about. This is very good. \\n\\nIn the second paragraph, it was mentioned that climate change has reduced the water cleanliness, causing a problem for people who make their lives from farmland. This is good point but never discussed later, how genetically modified organisms can help solving this problem. This section ends with potential of genetically modified crops for climate change. \\n\\nThe third paragraph is very well written and discussed how genetically modified plants are useful to control carbon dioxide. \\n\\nThe fourth paragraph is not quite clear to me. Genetic improvement of what? for some traits, which traits? More specificity required. \\n\\nIn the fifth paragraph, interesting topic was discussed. The resurrection of extinct species in the context of climate change is interesting. Ethical issue for this topic was also considered, which I think very good. It would be even better if the essay mentions about why and how re-establishing the interactions between species and environment before the mammoths disappeared give the current ecosystem chance to recover? \\n\\nThe conclusion is impressive. Very good summary of your findings. Well done! \\n\\nSmall point:\\nSingh P et al \\\"Publication year is missing\\\".\"],[\"Urszula McClurg\",58,0.362,\"This is a very good essay. You have done a lot of relevant reading and considered some interesting aspects of wider impact. However it would have been beneficial to also discuss the way drugs and insecticides impact the ecology, environment and human health, your conclusion section feels quite lacking. You also need to work on your written English.\"],[\"Mike Speed\",50,0.28186813186813187,\"This is a pleasure to read. Very well informed, very well written; always interesting and engaging. \\n\\nImprovements?\\nSo not very much could be improved here, but I could see some scope to tighten the structure a bit, bet a slightly more systematic approach across the paragraphs. \\n\\nBut - very well done!\"],[\"Igor Barsukov\",69,0.030782312925170086,\"Comprehensive, well-written discussion of DDT, but this is not the question of the essay. It should be a much more general discussion of insecticides and drugs. Some of your arguments may not be valid for other insecticides that are less harmful. There also a general question of whether insecticides should be used to control mosquitoes. In the present form the essay is very limited and not addressing the question.\"],[\"Igor Barsukov\",45,0.04884353741496599,\"Very strong essay, clearly arguing for the past and future values of the structural biology. Could be made stronger with cryoEM and going to larger systems, possibly even cells and EM tomography, as well as single molecule X-ray . References are not fully up to date.\"],[\"Jack Fitzpatrick\",75,0.2625,\"This is a good essay attempt. There is relevant content, and it is clear the topic has been researched properly. There are some issues with the structure of the essay, some paragraphs aren't as defined as they could be. Language is mostly ok but there are some problems with sentence structure and punctuation. There are some problems with citations/references which are important to correct for next time as not to raise academic integrity issues.\"],[\"Khandaker Shadia\",99,0.32,\"You did a good job considering this your first assignment. The essay reflected a fair amount of research and your attempt to produce a logical sequence. Sentence making and grammar need a lot of attention. Try to use some external software/ program to check the grammar after completing the assignment. This will help you identify the errors and you'll learn more. As I mentioned in the tutorial, try to write in an unbiased way while writing a critical review. Avoid taking a clear side and leave it for the reader to decide. Overall, it was a good effort.\"],[\"Robert Morris\",106,0.2545454545454545,\"Interesting essay, nicely structured with some comments for improvements attached. A big issue is no essay title, and choosing an essay title that I did not give you. You did not explain what GM was in this essay either. You present good published data throughout, and three main and distinct bodies in the essay. Improvements can be made by taking the Point Evidence and Evaluation approach further, however I see the effort you made with this. Always try and read your essay as someone who doesn't know anything about the subject, so you introduce what everything is before you talk about it. Good job overall!\"],[\"James Hall\",114,0.2855128205128205,\"Well done on your essay Jingzi -- I thought this was borderline good/very good. There were two main areas where you fell short. Most importantly, you didn't answer the question that was set! Be very careful to actually answer the question. In this essay, you used it as a prompt to describe the two concepts, but you never really compares insecticides and drugs head-to-head. I would've liked to see you make a judgement as to the most effective intervention. The other issue was with referencing, in many places you did not provide references to statements of fact. Please check the comments in the essay, and let me know if you have any questions.\"],[\"Natalia Savelyeva\",19,0.5,\"Overall, this is an excellent essay. You conclusion could be stronger; you seem unsure what the conclusions should be\"],[\"Natalia Savelyeva\",31,0.43200000000000005,\"Overall, this is an a very good essay. You seem to not be sure what the answer to the problem should be, I expect a bit more logical in your conclusions.\"],[\"Girvan Burnside\",48,0.45999999999999996,\"Good effort, You give a lot of good examples of the problems of both drug and insecticide approaches. Some of your choices of literature to reference could have been more directly relevant. There are multiple errors with your referencing, please read the referencing guidelines which are on CANVAS.\"],[\"Jack Fitzpatrick\",85,0.31375,\"This is a very good essay, well written and thought out. The structure is clear and the figures used are appropriate and well referenced. Some improvements could be made in the figure sizes as well as the legends. Whilst a deep understanding of the content is shown, there could be some improvement in translating the points into well balanced and thought out arguments. Language is entirely acceptable and academic, however, in some places can be 'wordy' and cumbersome to read. Overall a great attempt though!\"],[\"Jack Foster\",35,0.19166666666666665,\"This submission has been awarded a score of 0 because it is more than 5 days late.

She said that she will deal with that and get a score for the essay.\"],[\"Robert Morris\",102,0.3875091575091575,\"Good effort on this essay. The start of the essay was the strongest, a great introduction and first main body section. You made good points, and provided good evidence and evaluation, well structured in that way. Some structure issues with a risk in the benefit section. Try to keep one large main body section for each point: benefits and risks. Your conclusion seemed rushed, especially compared to the quality of your introduction. Your font is taking up too much space, and makes your reference list look very messy. See notes on essay for detailed feedback, all in all a great job here!\"],[\"Marcus Blagrove\",86,0.14583333333333334,\"good essay, you can improve it by being more specific in your sceintific language. there were a lot of colloquial terms in here, and not much depth in the biology. e.g. how/what specifically can GOF help us understand? and not much presentation of alternatives. conssequenlty you hade little discussion as the alternatives were not there to discuss. so: to improve for next time, more specific and scientific language, and give alternatives where they exist (and state where they do not). then discuss all of it togeather\"],[\"Carrie Duckworth\",172,0.053125000000000006,\"You have covered several key points very well and have selected some interesting case studies.  You English is sound although contains some grammatical errors and a few areas where I'm not sure whether your essay is written as intended but it will likely improve with the fullness of time.  Try to ensure that each paragraph you use has an introductory sentence and a concluding sentence and each covers a slightly different angle of the argument you are trying to present.  Also consider using headings for different sections of your essay to help guide the reader to the aspect of the topic you are about to discuss.  Some discussion about benefits and risks to the individual and how they might differ to the whole population may also strengthen some of the points you mention.  Could these studies be replaced by animal studies or cell line/in vitro studies? If not, why not? Are there any examples from the literature where animal infection studies don't give the same response as human volunteer studies?\"],[\"Sarah Donegan\",16,0.35888888888888887,\"Very good. Well done. The main area for improvement was use of academic language and phrasing.\"],[\"Amy Chadwick\",138,0.08310185185185186,\"You have worked very hard to read lots of scientific articles on this subject and you use some of the detail from them well in your essay. However, I think that the essay lacked a strong structure, and some of the papers that you used and included were not relevant to the subject, or not well organised in the essay. Next time, try harder to think about exactly what the main point of every paragraph is and then only use those articles which are directly linked to the point. There are a couple of other comments on the document about improving the introduction and conclusion. Overall, I think that you have a good understanding of the subject and the importance of including precise scientific detail. Now, you should try to work on essay structure and logical flow more.\"],[\"Jack Fitzpatrick\",51,0.5033000000000001,\"This is an excellent essay and was a joy to read.

This is really easy to read! Be careful about altering titles of your set assignments.

You have an occasional sentence that could be made slightly less ambiguous but in general your scientific writing is excellent. One key point that you didn't raise was the ethical issue about whether volunteers should be paid to enter a study - eg someone may be in debt and need the money but would rather not otherwise take part.

I may not agree with all the statements made, but they are made well and backed up with evidence. However, for a higher mark, I would want to see more consideration given to the opposing view. In this essay, you appeared to decide early on which side your views fell on, and the remainder of the essay provided (very well written) justification. For a higher mark I would like to see more consideration of the opposing side. This reads as an opinion piece against studying pathogens on volunteers, rather than a critical review."

The first was a little vague and broad but the importance was much clearer by the second paragraph. I liked the section on why animal models are used and an example of where this has not worked. It would be stronger if the example was pathogen-related and you expanded the scientific detail of why these models are inaccurate. Try to avoid confusing some key terms and also drifting too much into therapeutics. While this is a really important aspect, the question actually asks about testing pathogen virulence. Make sure you answer this question. What is virulence. How is it measured. You could also display your depth of knowledge by covering what human challenge models are available. This would make a good figure and would certainly be a way to gain higher marks. You touched a a little on using health volunteers and mentioned a specific patient group. This was a missed opportunity to discuss whether healthy volunteers may be representatiev of at-risk groups. You can also strengthen your writing by referring to codes of ethics. Why do they exist and what do we have to adhere to? What would be considered ethicala nd what wouldn't.

For example, what is the Nuremburg code and why is it important. Don't be afraid to highlight the complexity of the topic. You finish off by saying the using human volunteers to study virulence is ethical. But really it's more complex than that.

My major comment is that the arguments were quite mixed about the pros and cons related to honeybee extinction, and comments about self-pollinating crops or pollinators and human interventions (not identified in any detail) could negate this. Therefore, it wasn't clear what conclusions were to be drawn until the very end. In that sense, the synthesis and evaluation could have been improved."

Most of all, you could have (a) done more to explain the criteria you and others use to evaluate ethical considerations, and (b) provided a few more examples of where human infection has been used to study pathogens. You give only the example of TGN1412 (not a pathogen) and SARS-CoV-2 (where you don't really explain how controlled infections might be used). There are numerous other examples which span the whole spectrum from largely ethical to extremely unethical (and verging on crimes against humanity).

FOr higher marks, you could clarify the structure and make the text more concise, while thinking more about the assumptions in the question.\n\nKnowledge: mainly fine but a few factual errors, e.g. malaria affects the Northern hemisphere just as much as the Southern (west Africa, indian subcontinent). Teh relevance of the vaccine section (which are not drugs) is not made relevant to the question.\n\nComprehension: good understanding throughout.\n\nSynthesis: you could make the points linking the paragraphs together stronger, its not entirely clear whether you think insecticides and drugs have been successful or not. You have a reasonable conclusion, uses vaccines instead of either insectides or therapeutic drugs, but you need to state what weakness they share that vaccines overcome. A critical comparison of the factors affecting their use/abuse would be welcome (both need epidemiological information, strategy depends on context and on infrastructure).\n\nRemember, you have to answer the question, but you don't have to accept its assumptions (i.e. that it must be either/or, or that they are fundamentally different, or that there is a single answer)\n\nStructure: good but paragraphs too long? I would split them into history/method and then critical assessment of their success. You have brought new information into the  conclusion, and some is inconsistent with the body (i.e. effect of hazing on children given as principal drawback of insecticides but elsewhere you say that \"All four classes \nare safe to be used in indoor replant sprays (IRS))\".

You do write well and in a clear manner, however you do rely in places abit too much on quotations and would like to see more of this put into your own words. I also felt you relied a little too much on websites although you did also have some primary sources too, maybe try in future to have greater emphasis on the latter in the text. You could have also expanded in some places on your discussion, maybe a little more detail on how much of an issue drug resistance is for example. You also need to revisit how to cite references in the text, and be consistent in this. Hope these comments are helpful."

I do get a sense that you have read about & are interested by this area. \n\nImprovements?\n\nI think that the essay should have been about whether commercial application of stem cell therapies is on balance a risk (and without efficacy), or a benefit for paying patients. I can see arguments that private providers are not benefiting their patients - perhaps they offer therapies with poor outcomes etc. What I think you have written is a broader essay about the pros/cons of SCT. Now, given that this is a \"practice\" essay etc. this will not affect the mark greatly. \n\nThere are sections where your phrasing can be simpler and clearer, do have a look in the text and do have a chat if there are issues you would like to cover. \n\nI think, make more time for proof-reading if you can, and ensure that the arguments are as logical as you can get. One example is the use of foetal cells - you can given an appearance that all SCT is via this method, but later on talk about adult somatic cells."

I thought the historical context worked well to really highlight the questionable ethical background of the area.\nThe main part of the essay was heavily skewed towards SARS-CoV2 and this could have been balanced with some examples of the different human challange models available. This would work well as a figure or a table. The vaccine figure you used could have been made more relevant by ensuring it came back to human volunteer models. The section that discussed the poor representation of certain key groups was great. This would be made even stronger by the use of more examples where virulence differs. \nThe argument about models (either animals or in vitro) was great and would be further strengthened by using examples of disease relevant models. To gain higher marks, you could include a critiqu of these. In many cases, animal or in vitro models do exist but they often fail to recapitulate the human environment. This could also be an argument for using human volunteers. \nYour use of supplementary material was excellent.\nOverall, this was a really good essay that was enjoyable to read. To gain higher marks, include further critique and enure that text is supported by hard facts and figures from published data. Display your depth of knowledge by providing lots of examples early on, even if you go on to focus on a single example in depth. Well done."

           "Overall: a very good essay with a mature and easy writing style, which includes a suitable range of relevant material and some critical analysis of the material, supported by appropriate citations. It could be improved with more balance to the different sides of the question, or by critically examining the question itself.\n\nKnowledge: great introduction, very good coverage of material relating to insecticides, but insufficient explanation of anti-malarial drugs, their successes and weaknesses. Even if favouring one argument over another, you must do justice to the side you are trying to dismiss.\n\nComprehension: mostly fine but it is difficult to assess whether you understand the drug situation gor lack of material.\n\nSynthesis: you have made a sound argument to support you conclusion, but it would be much more persuasive if you supported it with statistics on how many different insecticides there are available vs. drugs.\n\nStructure: sensible progression of argument.\n\nSupplementary: the material you have is used well to support your statements, try to double the number of citations next time.\n\nLanguage: well written with clear explanations of facts and arguments. No need to place apostrophes around key words and phrases. To direcly quote something, put speech marks (\"\") around it, but you would do this only rarely in a scientific essay."

You focussed mainly on geneic modification of plants to protect them from drought or flood. What about increased crop yield in general?  You also kept using draught instead of drought.

You were talking about symbiotic algae, then bacteria, then mobile genetic elements. It was all just  a little disjointed.\nIn yur conclusion, you should not introduce new conceots/ideas.

Defining the importance of the problem, the key terms to be used and the question to be addressed is critical at the beginning of the essay, but the opening was a bit confused.

Much of the material cited, while sometimes in primary sources, was out-of-date and abbreviations were used without being defined.

However, the essay was quite hard to follow as you repeatedly used sweeping generalisations with little evidence to back this up. You could include examples of recent human volunteer models (there are quite a few across viruses and bacteria). The reference to ethics committees showed some understanding of the processes involved but there as no detail. A scientific essay should include data from published studies. You could include a figure or a table (perhaps one that showed recently used models). Try to be critical - there may be scenarios in which these approaches are ethical and scenarios where they are not. What about disease severity? (like healthy volunteers and SARS-CoV2) Should there be available treatments? (like some of the Streptococcus pneumoniae models). What are the alternatives? Do these have key limitations? If you ask yourself some clear questions, this will help you structure your essay. Using examples shows the reader that you have a depth of knowledge. Using specific language rather than sweeping generalisations shows you have deep comprehension. These essays don't have a clear right or wrong answer.

The section on vaccines is not relevant to the question; it might have been had you made the argument, e.g. by saying that both drugs and insecticides are unsustainable and that only vaccines could be.\n\nComprehension: Mostly accurate, but the lack of any detailed description of some topics, e.g. ACT, suggests a lack of understanding also.\n\nSynthesis: you have a reasonable conclusion, but it isn't clear from what you have written why you have arrived at that point. You need to make more points as you move through the argument; you cannot assume that the reader will draw any conclusions from the material presented.\n\nStructure: sensible but more consolidation is needed, you need to include linker sentences to explain why one paragraph is followed by the next.

However, at one point you confuse honeybees with pollinators in general, meaning your conclusions are a little over-exaggerated. I would have also liked to see a discussion of potential man-made alternatives to natural bee pollination- these approaches may not be morally good, but they could certainly help mitigate any bee loss."

           "Some additional feedback:\nKnowledge base and relevance: \nStrictly speaking, some of what you have written is not directly relevant to the question. For example, where you talk about wasps: ‘They are excellent predators of a variety of major crop pests, such as aphids. Their exploitative associations  have  shaped  the  evolution  of  invertebrates,  maintaining  balance  and  biodiversity.’  Although interesting, it is not directly relevant to the question. \nAnother example: ‘But in a world without the hatred to wasps, only imagine the possibilities.’ Here, it is not clear how this contributes to answering the question (at least not without going into more detail).\nAnd another: ‘Species  like  the  grassland  butterfly  have  decreased  by  25%  in  the  most  stable  regions. Additionally, a single year of drought in 1976 caused butterfly species to fall by 76% in the UK (Ritchie,  2021)’ Is this relevant? If it is, you need to explain how.\nIn terms of knowledge: as per my text comment, it would be good to include a definition of 'honeybee'. What species are we talking about? (scientific name, taxon) Also, you may want to include a similar kind of information as you provide for the wasp: what is the importance of honeybees etc.\nStructure:\nI would advise against using short-ish paragraphs, this makes the essay slightly disjointed. Try to aim for three main paragraphs in a 1000 word essay (in addition to intro and conclusion). Each or the main paragraphs should have an overarching theme – you can test this by trying to find a ‘heading’ for each paragraph (I don’t recommend actually using sub-headings in your final essay but it’s a useful exercise)\n\nHope this helps."

Your introduction was about pathogens/diseases rather than the topic- introduce the topic! You provide a descriptive pros and cons of in vitro/in vivo/human studies, but do not really address the major issue surrounding ethics. You provide some examples- which is good, but there is so much room to discuss ethical issues regarding these examples."

You also used supplementary sources well and structured your answer nicely. In places, I thought your arguments were slightly contradictory. For example, I don't think you can apply the Trolley problem argument and also advocate for the 'do no harm' clause of the Hippocratic oath. The two will often be in direct conflict. That said, raising them both as for/against arguments is a reasonable approach to take. To improve, you could have highlighted some examples of where human challenge studies have demonstrably aided our understanding of pathogen virulence."

You presented the material that you found well, and came to a balanced conclusion based on that material. However, I think there was a bit of misconception throughout the essay as to whether race (as we understand it) has a biological basis, such that race 'per se' could affect pharmacology. Certainly medical studies have been historically biased towards white people, and I agree that this is objectionable and hampered scientific progress. But this is not because there are consistent, significant, fundamental biological differences between different races. Instead, different alleles are at different frequencies in different 'races', so focusing on one or another can exclude important aspects of human diversity that could impact treatment outcomes. I've tried to provide some references in my feedback to help with this misconception but I would be happy to chat more about it. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Some historical examples (Edward Jenner small pox vaccination) would have been superb.\n \nYou have some got basics about virulence wrong. Its not much about penetration and survival- its about harmfulness or the severity of the disease. LD50 is not just pathogens- could be anything (drug, toxin, radiation etc) and they may not necessarily be the same in rats and humans. Your example of breast cancer trial isn't relevant. Was a pathogen involved there? I believe it was a therapeutic reagent trial- not admissible in this context. \n\nIt wouldn't be ethically favourable to endanger human lives. There has to be enough evidence and measures in place to advance to human trial stage- to ascertain virulence and find drugs, they may get some unforseen adverse effects, but to say .....'it may be considered ethically favourable to endanger the lives of human'.....hasn't been justified in your essay."

The main issue however is your referencing and sources of material, you rely on a few sources and whilst these are legitimate sources in most cases, you should always try and use mostly primary sources of information e.g. the peer reviewed literature, furthermore you need to fully write it in your own words and not patch work text from the sources. Finally, the way you have added intext citations is incorrect and you must give a reference list. Please look at the resources in the library, such as KnowHow and CiteThemRight, as referencing as last year you also had difficulty with referencing and its a area you should really concentrate some effort on as it will hold you back from getting higher marks.  I have also put other comments in the text which I hope will be helpful for you improving your essay writing."

           "Well done. I thought the introductory paragraph was good. You attempted to explain some of the key terms and reinforce their relevance. However, there are a few broad and sweeping statements. Avoid this as they are rarely true. Use careful language based on evidence from the scientific literature. For example, is the outcome of test ever 100% definite, particulary challenge with a pathogen. Is this realistic criteria? Again, in paragraph 2 you make another sweeping statement about antibodies protecting volunteers from harm. I think you should think more about the scenarios in which a human model would be acceptable and when it wouldn't. This would show comprehension. There is little background about what ones are available. I did like the SARS-CoV2 example thought. By including this abckground, you would show a depth of knowledge. This could also be an opportunity to include a figure and add depth without adding to the word count. The historical aspect worked well but the language at times lapsed into a more informal style rather than a scientific style. Please also include a word count.

You've chosen some useful supplementary information sources and you've highlighted nice examples of ethical and unethical use of human challenge models. The biggest area for improvement is in your language. There are lots of spelling and grammar issues here. Individually, these are minor, but together they make the essay hard to follow. Re-reading your essay, slowly, several times after you've written it will help you identify typos. One other area to focus on would be on ensuring that each point you make is backed by a thorough description of the evidence underpinning it. For example, when you mention the contribution of human challenge models to development of covid 19 vaccines, I wanted to see the justification for that statement."

Everything is relevant, and almost all is covered; some more basic information would help, e.g. methods of insect control.\n\nComprehension: good understanding throughout.\n\nSynthesis: you have reached a well founded conclusion, that is supported by the text. While there are counterpoints to your argument, it is constructed well and based on considerations of the wider context of disease control. For more synthesis points, you could challenge the assumptions in the question. You have to answer the question, but you don't have to accept its assumptions (i.e. either/or, or that they are fundamentally different, or that there is a single answer). Challenging these assumptions is a good way to demonstrate critical thinking.\n\nStructure: sensible flow to the argument, with efforts to reach interim conclusions/linking points between paragraphs.\n\nSupplementary: excellent use of pertinent references to provide statistics and support the current consensus.\n\nLanguage: mature and considered prose throughout."

It is a bit too early stage to say that genetic modifications do not pose any direct risks to human though. Reference for CRISPR/Cas9 is essential but missing. At the end of introduction, what this essay will explore was stated, which is very good! \n\nThe second paragraph describes advantage for genetically modified plants to decrease carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. Well written but key references missing. Where did you obtain such results/information? \n\nThe third paragraph tells about a risk. Again it would be good to example some specific work with citation. \n\nThe fourth paragraph describes genetically modified crops for the climate crisis. Good example study (algae DNA) was shown but reference(s) is missing. \n\nThe fifth paragraph tells potential problem of the genetically modified crops. Good connection with the previous paragraph but again missing reference. \n\nThe sixth paragraph tells selective breeding of cattle as another possibility yo combat climate change. On the contrary may not suitable start. This is not really in contrast to the previous sentence/paragraph. This paragraph is quite independent as previous paragraphs focused on genetically modified crops. \n\nThe conclusion is good but it is not quite convincing to say that \"some countries need to revaluate the risks\" as your essay clearly mentioned potential problems with genetically modified organisms. \n\nOverall, good essay with main problem of lack of references. \n\nPlease look at slight modifications within the text. \n\nWell done."

For higher marks, you need to think around the question, discuss some of the other factors that determine success or failure (e.g. climate change, local epidemiological factors, land use etc.). Also, remember, you have to answer the question, but you don't have to accept its assumptions (i.e. that it has to be either/or, or that they are fundamentally different, or that there is a single answer). Challenging these assumptions is a good way to demonstrate critical thinking.\n\nStructure: very sensible and easy to follow.\n\nSupplementary: good use of citations to support statistics.\n\nLanguage: Needs redrafting, words missing, grammar missing, to the extent that meaning is unclear in places.

This information is patchy. Similarly the argument around tomatoes and the dislodging of pollen grains. I would have liked to learn more about this since you mentioned it!\nThe other point is the referencing which is of importance, concerning and not ok. You NEED to have an in-text reference even if you have alluded to the authors already.

In the reference list, et. Al. should be et. al.\n\nThe first paragraph covers history of human clinical trials but does not say what the essay will discuss or highlight about. It is also important to briefly mention who is Edward Jenner and What is the Willowbrook experiment. At least references required. Don't assume readers know everything. \n\nThe second paragraph first describes problem with pathogens throughout history and then story about smallpox vaccine. The connection to the smallpox vaccine was not clear. The previous sentence says that smallpox killed lot of people in 20th century and this led to Edward's vaccine?  13 million death cause by disease but not clear how much diseases caused by pathogens?, which is the main one in the essay. \"in the 20th century\" should come after 540 million people?  This paragraph ends with stressing importance of past mistakes which lead to the next section very well.\n\nThe third paragraph started from the Declaration of Helsinki. Reference needs for this. Then example of human trials for pathogens during WWII was described. Again, the Nuremberg Code requires reference. This paragraph finishes with controlled human infection study. Good end but brief deification of \"controlled\" is necessary as it's vague. \n\nThe fourth section is not clear to me. Why human challenge studies are more ethical than normal clinical trials? No example/evidence was shown within the essay. Under 10% of malaria vaccine clinical trials will progress to phase III, so what does this means? If you want to stress that this is low rate, then better to show example with higher success rate. If stress high, then other way round.

I liked how you had used the Hope and McMillan framework to discuss various sides of the argument. Your language was imprecise in places, so this is one area to focus on for the future. I also think there were a couple of weaknesses to your argument, particularly with regards to assessment of risk. I accept the principle that risk should ideally be no higher than in everyday life, but can we reasonably suggest this is the case for a typhoid or SARS-CoV-2 challenge trial?"

           "Knowledge: mostly, you have presented a suitable range of relevant material but it is underdeveloped in several places, e.g. your introduction claims that the infection rate has increased massively since 2020; you need to provide a citation for this because the recent global trend has been in decline. Also your description of drug administration is not detailed enough. The sections on vaccines and diagnoses are not made relevant to the question - they might be relevant but you have say how. \n\nComprehension: there are few places where inaccuracies suggest that you don't entirely understand, e.g. drug resistance is not found only in Africa but worldwide. There are inconsistencies or contradictions between your text and your table, e.g. you say there are \"no serious human and environmental health effects\" of insecticides but also that they can \"harm humans\" in the text.\n\n\nSynthesis: it is sometimes unclear why the argument takes the course it does because you have not finished each paragraph by making a point. Without these statements, the text becomes a list of facts, from which the reader is supposed to draw their own conclusion, and that won't always be what you intend. Your conclusion is too long given the shortness of the essay altogether. You present a sound argument, and I like the way you show the importance of a third factor (epidemiological surveillance) to the success or failure of both treatment approaches. This shows criticial thinking, but you could make the point more forcefully, i.e. say that neither approach can be successful without understanding the epidemiological context. draw out the factors that make both solutions succeed or fail, like epidemiological surveillance.\n\nStructure: Sensible layout, but lack of joining sentences means that the progression of argument is haphazard - e.g. transition into Figure 1 discussion - how does this relate to the preceeding paragraph? The table is a good idea, but you need to write about it in the text.\n\nSupplementary: citations are thin generally, but good use of the DDT resistance study - for more marks explain how representative this is of the current situation.\n\nLanguage: put species names in Italics and give the full name on first use.\nGenerally, some redrafting was needed because some prose is awkward, e.g. \"There have been instances where insecticides have been known to not control the presence of malaria due to resistance, however, there is nothing to prove that this is the case and is thereby, still used as a controlling measure.\" Aside from the grammatical errors, its not clear why something that is 'known' is discarded as unproven."

The insecticide section was good, you provided arguments for an against that, and you introduced nets well. Some words used incorrectly but that will get better with experience. Short essay at 700 words, when there was a lot more to talk about like chemoprophylaxis drugs that are widely used for prevention with travellers. A good attempt at introducing and concluding, the largest draw back however was the lack of drugs being mentions and clear evaluation about what these data mean."

Explaining the history of example drug development adds interest. It's not clear why controlling malaria with insecticides is described as a 'second choice' - does this mean less preferred, or just an alternative? Again good detail in this section. Important limitations regarding resistance and environmental concerns are also mentioned. The conclusion paragraph is good, and it is made clear that the best practice now is a combination of drugs and insecticides, but that vaccines may come to dominate in the future."

As long as consistent in the essay it is not major issue but I would recommend you to use British as we are in UK. So it should be written as \"Industrialisation\". \n\nThe first paragraph clearly states what the essay will discuss about. This is very good. \n\nIn the second paragraph, it was mentioned that climate change has reduced the water cleanliness, causing a problem for people who make their lives from farmland. This is good point but never discussed later, how genetically modified organisms can help solving this problem. This section ends with potential of genetically modified crops for climate change. \n\nThe third paragraph is very well written and discussed how genetically modified plants are useful to control carbon dioxide. \n\nThe fourth paragraph is not quite clear to me. Genetic improvement of what? for some traits, which traits? More specificity required. \n\nIn the fifth paragraph, interesting topic was discussed. The resurrection of extinct species in the context of climate change is interesting. Ethical issue for this topic was also considered, which I think very good. It would be even better if the essay mentions about why and how re-establishing the interactions between species and environment before the mammoths disappeared give the current ecosystem chance to recover? \n\nThe conclusion is impressive. Very good summary of your findings. Well done! \n\nSmall point:\nSingh P et al \"Publication year is missing\"."

It is perfectly fine to set an argument up one way or the other (to prove or disprove the topic), but don't alter the set title.....this can cause you to loose a lot of points on an assignment or exam because you might fail to cover something important that is no longer present in your worded title.\n\nPlease see my in text comments for more detailed feedback.  In general, make sure you complete your arguments when you are writing them.  Don't make your reader try to decide what you are talking about, make sure ALL your thoughts are clearly written down."

A good rule of thumb is that whenever you are stating something like X% of crops are animal pollinated (ie there is a number involved) or a study was done to show, you should link the information to a citation. Sometimes you do exactly this and there's no problem but sometimes it is missing and becomes more noticeable by it's absence.\n\nOccasionally, you bring up a point (such as the economic costs of losing bees) and fail to develop it much further. For the very highest marks, you will need to fully develop these ideas and elaborate more on teh consequences.\n\nOverall a very good essay. Well done."

           "A good attempt here and you've raised some really good points. There are some things that hold you back though.\n\nThe biggest and most obvious is referencing. In this case you have simply placed links in the text and this is not the format we accept. A proper scientific reference should be formatted in text as (Author Date). For example I would cite your essay using the following citation (Thatcher 2022) in text and then more complete details in the reference list. Furthermore, the sources you have chosen look like good sources for research but not for citing in an essay. The overwhelming majority of your references in an essay need to be primary literature sources like scientific papers or the occasional textbook.\n\nMore generally, you raise some very good points in this essay and approach the rather frightening claims made with a healthy sense of skepticism. This is very good. Keep that critical thinking active at all times when you're presented with a claim like this. What I would like to see for some of the higher marks is you fully developing these points. You could discuss these in some more detail. For example, your point about economic strife cause by bee extinction is good but you could go on to explain that civilisational struggle and even collapse is not quite extinction. You get close to this point but don't quite explain it. As a note this is hard with short word counts so you've still raised some good issues here.\n\nAnother problem (and this is common to all student essays) is that sometimes you lose track of what you're saying and your sentence doesn't make sense. This is hard to solve when typing but can be addressed by proofreading. Most people struggle to proofread their own text so you may want to enlist a friend or family member. Alternatively, a good trick is to proofread your own text backwards, paragraph by paragraph. this should allow you to think about each paragraph (starting with the last) and whether it all hangs together and makes sense on its own. Try it. I promise you'll be impressed with how helpful it can be.\n\nOverall, although you may be disappointed with the mark here, you're actually not far from a much higher one if you solve some of the more fiddly problems like referencing. So don't get disheartened."

The text is a little unclear in the early paragraphs and I think you could do with a proofread just to make sure each sentence hangs together nicely.\n\nTo improve here, make sure you're developing your points fully. This can be difficult with limited word counts but it is a skill worth developing. For example, you raise some points that seem to just hang alone rather than connect to your central point. You mention vitamin A and leafcutter bees working close to the nest but don't explain why these points are important. For the very highest marks, you'll need to develop these ideas fully.\n\nI should add that the fourth paragraph does an excellent job of doing this. It is fully developed, brings in important evidence and makes a good argument. That should be a model for your writing in future. It's excellent.\n\nOverall, good work. Well done."

Well done.\n\nThe structure is a little odd but only minorly so, with some technical terms only being defined just under half-way through the text. It is usually best to be very clear about what you're discussing from as early as possible.\n\nSome points are under-developed, particularly when you discuss other modes of pollination. There is so much to elaborate on here. Could other animals cover for the honeybees? Could plants evolve or be manipulated by us and how much effort/money would that take? Could we just switch food sources? All these get touched upon in 1 or 2 sentences but could perhaps be paragraphs in their own right. For a short essay like this, a little more development would be ideal.\n\nOverall a very good essay. Well done."

Ultimately this kind of thing is worth very few marks (1 or 2) in most cases but since it's easy, try enlisting a friend or relative to proofread. Alternatively, proofread your own text by reading each paragraph in isolation starting from the end of the essay and working back to the start. It can be a good way to analyze your own structure.\n\nThe points you raise here are well researched and well though out. you bring in good evidence for your major claims and it really helps support the arguments you make. I would say that your conclusion surprised me. I had gathered from your main text that you were very worried about drug resistance and would prefer other methods. This is usually a sign that your weighting is a little off and maybe you could have developed your concerns about insecticides more. For example the blanket use of insecticides can be dangerous to other ecosystem components and you don't really cover this.\n\nOverall, a good essay. You are a little verbose sometimes so try going back through your text and trying to ruthlessly cut out unneeded lines or words. You might be suprised how much space you can free up. Very well done."

Your piece is well written and well researched.\n\nThere are a lot of references (which is good) but the sources are a little suspect. There are too many news and popular science sources here. You need to be focussing on primary literature.\n\nAs for your conclusion, I think there is a slight flaw in your argument (don't worry it doesn't cost you many marks but it's important to be aware). The reduction in bee population and diversity that you point to is something that doesn't happen in isolation. It is probably not the case that all the other bees and other pollinators can chip in and cover the gap because they too are subject to the forces that are threatening bees. You slightly miss the chance to set up this point despite your good focus on non-honeybee species. I think it might change your argument if you were to consider that honeybees going extinct might be a harbinger of a more general ecological decline or even collapse. Nevertheless, your point is soundly argued that honeybees alone aren't going to finish us off.\n\nOverall a good essay with a decent structure and a well argued case. Well done."

However, I think you spend too little time on the major issue of pollination and agriculture- honeybees are used to pollinate many fruits and food plants around the world. Your discussion of potential technological replacements was good however. \\n\\nTwo ways you could improve are: 1) improving the number of references you have in the text, with more concrete examples, and 2) giving your opinion rather than giving hypothetical statements\"],[\"Nordine Helassa\",29,0.14242424242424243,\"This is a well-written essay covering some positive and negative aspects of stem cell therapies.

Your introduction was excellent and brought summaries of all key points into it which set the scene for the remainder of the essay.  I like the use of headings to introduce pros and cons of human studies.  I've indicated a few minor specific points throughout the text.  You have an occasional sentence that could be made slightly less ambiguous but in general your scientific writing is excellent. One key point that you didn't raise was the ethical issue about whether volunteers should be paid to enter a study - eg someone may be in debt and need the money but would rather not otherwise take part.  Does this impact on how studies are administered?\"],[\"Edward Emmott\",128,0.3346153846153846,\"Overall this was an excellent essay. It was well structured, and the referencing to the UK goverment guidlines was very well done and entirely appropriate.\\n\\nI would have liked to give this a higher mark. I may not agree with all the statements made, but they are made well and backed up with evidence. However, for a higher mark, I would want to see more consideration given to the opposing view. In this essay, you appeared to decide early on which side your views fell on, and the remainder of the essay provided (very well written) justification. For a higher mark I would like to see more consideration of the opposing side. This reads as an opinion piece against studying pathogens on volunteers, rather than a critical review.\"],[\"Pat Eyers\",22,0.375,\"I enjoyed the links to medical science. Probably needs a bit more background (how many types of honey bees, evolutionary niches, etc)\"],[\"Jason Parsons\",120,0.1433333333333333,\"A very good essay that argued that if the honeybee were to become extinct, then mankind would suffer but would nevertheless be able to adapt and survive. This centred on points such as nutrition and the economy, but then suggested that other pollinators including those man made could replace and sustain those provided by the honeybee. There was also very good use of figures and statistics to support the essay. A major comment to improve the essay would be around structure and layout. Possibly sub-headings could have been used to highlight the major arguments but also there were quite a few separate paragraphs, including some related to the same points, that could have been combined for improved reading and clarity.\"],[\"John Woolley\",54,0.21416666666666667,\"Overall a well written essay, that deals with the question at hand.

You have used a good mixture of source material including original articles, and the in text citations/referencing are well formatted. To improve further, you could include some specific examples of stem cell therapies, and try to avoid using colloquial language and direct quotes.\"],[\"Mike Speed\",109,0.5142857142857142,\"There is good material here - you have found interesting materials and used them to address the essay title. I liked the contrasting examples, and a sensible focus on agriculture. \\n\\nImprovements\\n\\nI think the biggest improvement you can make is to make the written English clearer, and to explain the science in a more informative way.  Do have a look at my comments on the text, and i will be happy to chat it through. One way to improve this could be to do more proof-reading before submission. \\n\\nDo think about the length of paragraphs, where should the text be separated in this way? \\n\\nDo use Author/Date referencing, not numbers.\"],[\"Robert Morris\",120,0.05000000000000001,\"Your essay did not answer the question, as there was no mention of the control of malaria with drugs; no insecticide vs drugs as control methods. There was no introductory section, where we introduce malaria and its importance in general, and then get specific to the essay question and what this essay will talk about. Citation and referencing is incorrect, and the use of three references is not enough. The structure of the essay does not flow, with random paragraphs and isolated sentences, simplest acceptable formatting would be: paragraph 1) intro, 2) insecticides, 3) drugs and 4) conclusion. Your English is your strongest attribute here, but with some work and effort on everything mentioned will greatly improve your academic writing.\"],[\"Robert Morris\",15,0.0,\"Furthermore, this essay is 500 words when a 1000 word essay was tasked to you.\"],[\"Mark Morgan\",106,0.13558333333333333,\"Generally, well written and well structured and you present a persuasive argument. Although, it is rather one-sided.\\n\\nThe narrative of the text is a bit disjointed in places. It would also benefit from greater use of commas, to avoid ambiguity.\\n\\nVery good use of secondary sources to back up claims. However, the essay would have benefitted by using numbers from these studies to demonstrate the magnitude of the problem, rather than just broad statements.\\n\\nOdd citation formatting in places.

Well done. I thought the second paragraph made a better introduction than the first. The first was a little vague and broad but the importance was much clearer by the second paragraph. I liked the section on why animal models are used and an example of where this has not worked. It would be stronger if the example was pathogen-related and you expanded the scientific detail of why these models are inaccurate. Try to avoid confusing some key terms and also drifting too much into therapeutics. While this is a really important aspect, the question actually asks about testing pathogen virulence. Make sure you answer this question. What is virulence. How is it measured. You could also display your depth of knowledge by covering what human challenge models are available. This would make a good figure and would certainly be a way to gain higher marks. You touched a a little on using health volunteers and mentioned a specific patient group. This was a missed opportunity to discuss whether healthy volunteers may be representatiev of at-risk groups. You can also strengthen your writing by referring to codes of ethics. Why do they exist and what do we have to adhere to? What would be considered ethicala nd what wouldn't. Overall your scientific writing style is good and you used some really good supplementary material.\"],[\"Jo Fothergill\",5,0.0,\"See in text comments too.\"],[\"Connor Lamb\",45,0.25,\"Thank you for the feedback\\u263a\\ufe0f I understand what you\\u2019ve put in the comments and see where I could\\u2019ve improved.

I liked the opening sentence which immediately put the topic into a historial context. Try not to use references from websites. You should be looking towards mostly scientific articles and only websites like that if it's really necessary. You also have a tendency to slip into unscientific language. I have noted this in the in text comments. Try to use specific examples, particularly if you say things like \\\"in the experiment\\\", make it clear what teh experiment was and why it was important. When you include an in text citation, do not put a full stop before it. Put it with the sentence it belongs with. Make sure you fully explain concepts and other things that you refer to. For example, what is the Nuremburg code and why is it important. Don't be afraid to highlight the complexity of the topic. You finish off by saying the using human volunteers to study virulence is ethical. But really it's more complex than that. If it's a pathogen with a really high mortality rate and no treatment then it really wouldn't. To gain higher marks you could also use a figure. One highlighting the different challenge models would really work here.\"],[\"Jo Fothergill\",6,0.0,\"Look a tthe intext comments too\"],[\"Masoud Isanejad\",73,0.23500000000000001,\"Hi Ella\\n\\nthis is really good work. as you can see in rubric would be an improvement if there are figures, supplementary material and a using headings for a structured writing.

The introduction outlines the landscape of the topic, and the scale of the problem. The essay is clearly structured and discusses the advantages and limitations of drugs and insecticides in a logical manner. The argument leads on to describe both of these options as falling short of a long term solution, and the potential of vaccines is introduced (clear evidence of synthesis of ideas). There is good evidence of background reading throughout, however there are a few places where additional references and details could have been included (e.g. current malaria vaccine development). The conclusion paragraph is clear. An enjoyable essay to read, well done.\"],[\"Ainhoa Mielgo Iza\",37,-0.01666666666666667,\"This essay shows a deep breath of research and knowledge on this topic.

In general this is a nice essay.  Try and get more of your information from the scientific literature, which has been peer reviewed (reviewed, critiqued and improved following advice from experts in the field). Make sure you complete your thoughts on paper, don't leave the reader to decide what you meant. Lastly, try to use fewer pronouns (this, these, it, etc), which are vague and in determinant.

Your strengths are your use of previously published work and you show that you understand how to make the Point, Evidence, Evaluate structure work, but it needs to be more consistent and made even better by explaining the important bits from published work and a good evaluation showing you understand others results in relation to your own essay. The structure of the introduction and conclusion reads correct, but the information presented in them could be worked on. Reference list looks good, however no need to number them and citations are incorrect (see notes).

Well written and researched :-)\"],[\"Jason Parsons\",98,0.09916666666666665,\"In general, a very good essay which explored the concerns if honeybee populations were to become extinct. Arguments focussed mainly on crop production and human health, but also briefly on ecosystems and the economic impact. My major comment is that the arguments were quite mixed about the pros and cons related to honeybee extinction, and comments about self-pollinating crops or pollinators and human interventions (not identified in any detail) could negate this. Therefore, it wasn't clear what conclusions were to be drawn until the very end.

Most of all, you could have (a) done more to explain the criteria you and others use to evaluate ethical considerations, and (b) provided a few more examples of where human infection has been used to study pathogens. You give only the example of TGN1412 (not a pathogen) and SARS-CoV-2 (where you don't really explain how controlled infections might be used). There are numerous other examples which span the whole spectrum from largely ethical to extremely unethical (and verging on crimes against humanity).

However, the essay was quite hard to follow as you repeatedly used sweeping generalisations with little evidence to back this up. You could include examples of recent human volunteer models (there are quite a few across viruses and bacteria). The reference to ethics committees showed some understanding of the processes involved but there as no detail. A scientific essay should include data from published studies. You could include a figure or a table (perhaps one that showed recently used models). Try to be critical - there may be scenarios in which these approaches are ethical and scenarios where they are not. What about disease severity? (like healthy volunteers and SARS-CoV2) Should there be available treatments? (like some of the Streptococcus pneumoniae models). What are the alternatives? Do these have key limitations? If you ask yourself some clear questions, this will help you structure your essay. Using examples shows the reader that you have a depth of knowledge.

However, I think there was a bit of misconception throughout the essay as to whether race (as we understand it) has a biological basis, such that race 'per se' could affect pharmacology. Certainly medical studies have been historically biased towards white people, and I agree that this is objectionable and hampered scientific progress. But this is not because there are consistent, significant, fundamental biological differences between different races. Instead, different alleles are at different frequencies in different 'races', so focusing on one or another can exclude important aspects of human diversity that could impact treatment outcomes.

Its not much about penetration and survival- its about harmfulness or the severity of the disease. LD50 is not just pathogens- could be anything (drug, toxin, radiation etc) and they may not necessarily be the same in rats and humans. Your example of breast cancer trial isn't relevant. Was a pathogen involved there? I believe it was a therapeutic reagent trial- not admissible in this context. \\n\\nIt wouldn't be ethically favourable to endanger human lives.

However, its quite disjointed and could have flowed better. The main issue however is your referencing and sources of material, you rely on a few sources and whilst these are legitimate sources in most cases, you should always try and use mostly primary sources of information e.g. the peer reviewed literature, furthermore you need to fully write it in your own words and not patch work text from the sources. Finally, the way you have added intext citations is incorrect and you must give a reference list. Please look at the resources in the library, such as KnowHow and CiteThemRight, as referencing as last year you also had difficulty with referencing and its a area you should really concentrate some effort on as it will hold you back from getting higher marks.

Use careful language based on evidence from the scientific literature. For example, is the outcome of test ever 100% definite, particulary challenge with a pathogen. Is this realistic criteria? Again, in paragraph 2 you make another sweeping statement about antibodies protecting volunteers from harm. I think you should think more about the scenarios in which a human model would be acceptable and when it wouldn't. This would show comprehension. There is little background about what ones are available. I did like the SARS-CoV2 example thought. By including this abckground, you would show a depth of knowledge.

However, you don't state what the aim of your essay is.\\nThere were a number of issues with grammar. Some sentences were split into two separate ones when they should be a single senetnce, and conversely, some sentences could have been split into separate ones. There were also a few spelling errors and/or typos. You should carefully check over any written work you submit.\\nYou also made errors with your referencing. in the main body of the text, you shouldn't include initials. Further, when there are multiple authors, you only cited the first author. If ther are less than three, you should cite them all, and if there are more than three you should cite the first author and use et al. Your final reference list should also be in alphabetical order.\"],[\"Kazuhiro Yamamoto\",342,0.1130797101449275,\"Title needs to stand by making it bold or put underline.\\n\\nReference format is different from Harvard style. For example, (Lipstick M, et. al., 2014) in the correct one. In the reference list, et. Al. should be et. al.\\n\\nThe first paragraph covers history of human clinical trials but does not say what the essay will discuss or highlight about. It is also important to briefly mention who is Edward Jenner and What is the Willowbrook experiment. At least references required. Don't assume readers know everything. \\n\\nThe second paragraph first describes problem with pathogens throughout history and then story about smallpox vaccine. The connection to the smallpox vaccine was not clear. The previous sentence says that smallpox killed lot of people in 20th century and this led to Edward's vaccine?  13 million death cause by disease but not clear how much diseases caused by pathogens?, which is the main one in the essay. \\\"in the 20th century\\\" should come after 540 million people?  This paragraph ends with stressing importance of past mistakes which lead to the next section very well.\\n\\nThe third paragraph started from the Declaration of Helsinki. Reference needs for this. Then example of human trials for pathogens during WWII was described. Again, the Nuremberg Code requires reference. This paragraph finishes with controlled human infection study. Good end but brief deification of \\\"controlled\\\" is necessary as it's vague. \\n\\nThe fourth section is not clear to me. Why human challenge studies are more ethical than normal clinical trials? No example/evidence was shown within the essay. Under 10% of malaria vaccine clinical trials will progress to phase III, so what does this means? If you want to stress that this is low rate, then better to show example with higher success rate. If stress high, then other way round. I believe that most of drug trial could be less that 10% success rate. \\n\\nThe conclusion is good with stating the student's own opinion. \\n\\nHope these helps to improve your essay or any kind of report writing. \\n\\nWell done.\"],[\"Daniel Neill\",90,0.3394444444444444,\"Lots of good stuff here Kerry.

For example, you can say that in this essay I will introduce example cases for controlled and uncontrolled human infection (CHI) studies and discuss about its future. Also, it is important to define what is the \\\"controlled\\\" human infection study as control means a lot.\\n\\nThe second paragraph listed up a few cases for CHI studies. Important studies were introduced. \\\"A CHI study is also much cheaper model...\\\" Cheaper than which model? \\n\\nThe third paragraph tells about the case against controlled human infections study.

Also your description of drug administration is not detailed enough. The sections on vaccines and diagnoses are not made relevant to the question - they might be relevant but you have say how. \\n\\nComprehension: there are few places where inaccuracies suggest that you don't entirely understand, e.g. drug resistance is not found only in Africa but worldwide. There are inconsistencies or contradictions between your text and your table, e.g. you say there are \\\"no serious human and environmental health effects\\\" of insecticides but also that they can \\\"harm humans\\\" in the text.\\n\\n\\nSynthesis: it is sometimes unclear why the argument takes the course it does because you have not finished each paragraph by making a point. Without these statements, the text becomes a list of facts, from which the reader is supposed to draw their own conclusion, and that won't always be what you intend. Your conclusion is too long given the shortness of the essay altogether. You present a sound argument, and I like the way you show the importance of a third factor (epidemiological surveillance) to the success or failure of both treatment approaches. This shows criticial thinking, but you could make the point more forcefully, i.e. say that neither approach can be successful without understanding the epidemiological context. draw out the factors that make both solutions succeed or fail, like epidemiological surveillance.\\n\\nStructure: Sensible layout, but lack of joining sentences means that the progression of argument is haphazard - e.g. transition into Figure 1 discussion - how does this relate to the preceeding paragraph? The table is a good idea, but you need to write about it in the text.\\n\\nSupplementary: citations are thin generally, but good use of the DDT resistance study - for more marks explain how representative this is of the current situation.\\n\\nLanguage: put species names in Italics and give the full name on first use.\\nGenerally, some redrafting was needed because some prose is awkward, e.g. \\\"There have been instances where insecticides have been known to not control the presence of malaria due to resistance, however, there is nothing to prove that this is the case and is thereby, still used as a controlling measure.\\\" Aside from the grammatical errors, its not clear why something that is 'known' is discarded as unproven.\"],[\"Marcus Blagrove\",25,0.705,\"very good content, but more discussion in the text would have improved it. instead of one-sided paragraphs, give alternatives and discuss as you go along.\"],[\"Jo Fothergill\",146,0.33828125000000003,\"Well done. This was an excellent attempt at this essay. I really enjoyed your use of examples and the way you focused on virulence. When you use examples, make sure you don't assume too much prior knowledge. For example, when you mention cagA try to explain what it is and why it's important. Try to avoid broad statements and use your specific examples. When you first use a bacterial name, write the full species name. After that, it can be shortened. To gain higher marks, you could include a figure.

Keep up the good work.\"],[\"Zhikai Xu\",12,0.0,\"It's a miss load of my draft, please see attempt 2\"],[\"Alan Cartmell\",61,0.11990740740740745,\"This was a good attempt. A little more detail is needed in places and you gave yourself the opportunity to do it but did not capitalise, HIV protease being the main example. The section about alphafold was a bit confused too and you may need to read into it more. Overall, not too bad. See in text comments for more detail.\"],[\"Nicola Williams\",75,0.20925000000000002,\"Well done Yishan on a very well structured and researched essay. It was very clear and you discussed the topic really well and backed up your statements and discussion with appropriate references. There were a few minor areas for improvement as indicated in the comments on the report and you could have mentioned a little more about how the drugs are used and also, brought in cost as well. Overall, you did an excellent job.\"],[\"Robert Morris\",60,0.27291666666666664,\"Good attempt. Some structure issues in your essay and sections. Keep the two arguments in different sections until the conclusion. What does all this data mean that you presented? There were also a lot of repeating. Formatting issues when using a full stop, and more published data could be included instead of news articles. Check comments attached for detailed feedback.\"],[\"Marcus Blagrove\",152,0.2613095238095238,\"Overall, you covered a wide range of points but the essay needed more specific points. e.g. many important details were not mentioned, just a field was mentioned. in other areas you discuss the biology/genetics but do not relate it to GOF. if you do this then your arguments focus more on the question and it makes the essay more focused. it also helps you to dicuss the points in relation to the question more easily.\\n\\nThe conclusion needs to be a reflection of what you have discussed in the essay rather than general points. \\n\\nTo improve I would suggest making sure that all of your points relate specifically to the question, in this case GOF. secondly, be specific when giving examnples, rather than just 'we don't know if viruses can adapt to the condition', state what conditions, give an example, and if it exists give a real-world example and reference ect.\"],[\"Bill Paxton\",29,0.6,\"I like the essay, It is well structed and written with good points argued.\\nSome more examples may help. discussing where it cannot be used ie HIV-1 research.\"],[\"Kazuhiro Yamamoto\",263,0.2361962365591398,\"The essay is well written but please consider the points below to improve your essay and any report writing. \\n\\nThe title can be bold or with underline to stand out. \\n\\nIndustrialization is American English. As long as consistent in the essay it is not major issue but I would recommend you to use British as we are in UK. So it should be written as \\\"Industrialisation\\\". \\n\\nThe first paragraph clearly states what the essay will discuss about. This is very good. \\n\\nIn the second paragraph, it was mentioned that climate change has reduced the water cleanliness, causing a problem for people who make their lives from farmland. This is good point but never discussed later, how genetically modified organisms can help solving this problem. This section ends with potential of genetically modified crops for climate change. \\n\\nThe third paragraph is very well written and discussed how genetically modified plants are useful to control carbon dioxide. \\n\\nThe fourth paragraph is not quite clear to me. Genetic improvement of what? for some traits, which traits? More specificity required. \\n\\nIn the fifth paragraph, interesting topic was discussed. The resurrection of extinct species in the context of climate change is interesting. Ethical issue for this topic was also considered, which I think very good. It would be even better if the essay mentions about why and how re-establishing the interactions between species and environment before the mammoths disappeared give the current ecosystem chance to recover? \\n\\nThe conclusion is impressive. Very good summary of your findings. Well done! \\n\\nSmall point:\\nSingh P et al \\\"Publication year is missing\\\".\"],[\"Urszula McClurg\",58,0.362,\"This is a very good essay. You have done a lot of relevant reading and considered some interesting aspects of wider impact. However it would have been beneficial to also discuss the way drugs and insecticides impact the ecology, environment and human health, your conclusion section feels quite lacking. You also need to work on your written English.\"],[\"Mike Speed\",50,0.28186813186813187,\"This is a pleasure to read. Very well informed, very well written; always interesting and engaging. \\n\\nImprovements?\\nSo not very much could be improved here, but I could see some scope to tighten the structure a bit, bet a slightly more systematic approach across the paragraphs. \\n\\nBut - very well done!\"],[\"Igor Barsukov\",69,0.030782312925170086,\"Comprehensive, well-written discussion of DDT, but this is not the question of the essay. It should be a much more general discussion of insecticides and drugs. Some of your arguments may not be valid for other insecticides that are less harmful. There also a general question of whether insecticides should be used to control mosquitoes. In the present form the essay is very limited and not addressing the question.\"],[\"Igor Barsukov\",45,0.04884353741496599,\"Very strong essay, clearly arguing for the past and future values of the structural biology. Could be made stronger with cryoEM and going to larger systems, possibly even cells and EM tomography, as well as single molecule X-ray . References are not fully up to date.\"],[\"Jack Fitzpatrick\",75,0.2625,\"This is a good essay attempt. There is relevant content, and it is clear the topic has been researched properly. There are some issues with the structure of the essay, some paragraphs aren't as defined as they could be. Language is mostly ok but there are some problems with sentence structure and punctuation. There are some problems with citations/references which are important to correct for next time as not to raise academic integrity issues.\"],[\"Khandaker Shadia\",99,0.32,\"You did a good job considering this your first assignment. The essay reflected a fair amount of research and your attempt to produce a logical sequence. Sentence making and grammar need a lot of attention. Try to use some external software/ program to check the grammar after completing the assignment. This will help you identify the errors and you'll learn more. As I mentioned in the tutorial, try to write in an unbiased way while writing a critical review. Avoid taking a clear side and leave it for the reader to decide. Overall, it was a good effort.\"],[\"Robert Morris\",106,0.2545454545454545,\"Interesting essay, nicely structured with some comments for improvements attached. A big issue is no essay title, and choosing an essay title that I did not give you. You did not explain what GM was in this essay either. You present good published data throughout, and three main and distinct bodies in the essay. Improvements can be made by taking the Point Evidence and Evaluation approach further, however I see the effort you made with this. Always try and read your essay as someone who doesn't know anything about the subject, so you introduce what everything is before you talk about it. Good job overall!\"],[\"James Hall\",114,0.2855128205128205,\"Well done on your essay Jingzi -- I thought this was borderline good/very good. There were two main areas where you fell short. Most importantly, you didn't answer the question that was set! Be very careful to actually answer the question. In this essay, you used it as a prompt to describe the two concepts, but you never really compares insecticides and drugs head-to-head. I would've liked to see you make a judgement as to the most effective intervention. The other issue was with referencing, in many places you did not provide references to statements of fact. Please check the comments in the essay, and let me know if you have any questions.\"],[\"Natalia Savelyeva\",19,0.5,\"Overall, this is an excellent essay. You conclusion could be stronger; you seem unsure what the conclusions should be\"],[\"Natalia Savelyeva\",31,0.43200000000000005,\"Overall, this is an a very good essay. You seem to not be sure what the answer to the problem should be, I expect a bit more logical in your conclusions.\"],[\"Girvan Burnside\",48,0.45999999999999996,\"Good effort, You give a lot of good examples of the problems of both drug and insecticide approaches. Some of your choices of literature to reference could have been more directly relevant. There are multiple errors with your referencing, please read the referencing guidelines which are on CANVAS.\"],[\"Jack Fitzpatrick\",85,0.31375,\"This is a very good essay, well written and thought out. The structure is clear and the figures used are appropriate and well referenced. Some improvements could be made in the figure sizes as well as the legends. Whilst a deep understanding of the content is shown, there could be some improvement in translating the points into well balanced and thought out arguments. Language is entirely acceptable and academic, however, in some places can be 'wordy' and cumbersome to read. Overall a great attempt though!\"],[\"Jack Foster\",35,0.19166666666666665,\"This submission has been awarded a score of 0 because it is more than 5 days late.

She said that she will deal with that and get a score for the essay.\"],[\"Robert Morris\",102,0.3875091575091575,\"Good effort on this essay. The start of the essay was the strongest, a great introduction and first main body section. You made good points, and provided good evidence and evaluation, well structured in that way. Some structure issues with a risk in the benefit section. Try to keep one large main body section for each point: benefits and risks. Your conclusion seemed rushed, especially compared to the quality of your introduction. Your font is taking up too much space, and makes your reference list look very messy. See notes on essay for detailed feedback, all in all a great job here!\"],[\"Marcus Blagrove\",86,0.14583333333333334,\"good essay, you can improve it by being more specific in your sceintific language. there were a lot of colloquial terms in here, and not much depth in the biology. e.g. how/what specifically can GOF help us understand? and not much presentation of alternatives. conssequenlty you hade little discussion as the alternatives were not there to discuss. so: to improve for next time, more specific and scientific language, and give alternatives where they exist (and state where they do not). then discuss all of it togeather\"],[\"Carrie Duckworth\",172,0.053125000000000006,\"You have covered several key points very well and have selected some interesting case studies.  You English is sound although contains some grammatical errors and a few areas where I'm not sure whether your essay is written as intended but it will likely improve with the fullness of time.  Try to ensure that each paragraph you use has an introductory sentence and a concluding sentence and each covers a slightly different angle of the argument you are trying to present.  Also consider using headings for different sections of your essay to help guide the reader to the aspect of the topic you are about to discuss.  Some discussion about benefits and risks to the individual and how they might differ to the whole population may also strengthen some of the points you mention.  Could these studies be replaced by animal studies or cell line/in vitro studies? If not, why not? Are there any examples from the literature where animal infection studies don't give the same response as human volunteer studies?\"],[\"Sarah Donegan\",16,0.35888888888888887,\"Very good. Well done. The main area for improvement was use of academic language and phrasing.\"],[\"Amy Chadwick\",138,0.08310185185185186,\"You have worked very hard to read lots of scientific articles on this subject and you use some of the detail from them well in your essay. However, I think that the essay lacked a strong structure, and some of the papers that you used and included were not relevant to the subject, or not well organised in the essay. Next time, try harder to think about exactly what the main point of every paragraph is and then only use those articles which are directly linked to the point. There are a couple of other comments on the document about improving the introduction and conclusion. Overall, I think that you have a good understanding of the subject and the importance of including precise scientific detail. Now, you should try to work on essay structure and logical flow more.\"],[\"Jack Fitzpatrick\",51,0.5033000000000001,\"This is an excellent essay and was a joy to read.

This is really easy to read! Be careful about altering titles of your set assignments.

Mitchell\",141,0.2666607142857143,\"A very well written essay with lots of good information and a clear structure. Well done.\\n\\nAt times, although you use excellent sources, they are not always in the right places. A good rule of thumb is that whenever you are stating something like X% of crops are animal pollinated (ie there is a number involved) or a study was done to show, you should link the information to a citation. Sometimes you do exactly this and there's no problem but sometimes it is missing and becomes more noticeable by it's absence.\\n\\nOccasionally, you bring up a point (such as the economic costs of losing bees) and fail to develop it much further. For the very highest marks, you will need to fully develop these ideas and elaborate more on teh consequences.\\n\\nOverall a very good essay. Well done.\"],[\"Christopher Mitchell\",405,0.26712121212121204,\"A good attempt here and you've raised some really good points. There are some things that hold you back though.\\n\\nThe biggest and most obvious is referencing. In this case you have simply placed links in the text and this is not the format we accept. A proper scientific reference should be formatted in text as (Author Date). For example I would cite your essay using the following citation (Thatcher 2022) in text and then more complete details in the reference list. Furthermore, the sources you have chosen look like good sources for research but not for citing in an essay. The overwhelming majority of your references in an essay need to be primary literature sources like scientific papers or the occasional textbook.\\n\\nMore generally, you raise some very good points in this essay and approach the rather frightening claims made with a healthy sense of skepticism. This is very good. Keep that critical thinking active at all times when you're presented with a claim like this. What I would like to see for some of the higher marks is you fully developing these points. You could discuss these in some more detail. For example, your point about economic strife cause by bee extinction is good but you could go on to explain that civilisational struggle and even collapse is not quite extinction. You get close to this point but don't quite explain it. As a note this is hard with short word counts so you've still raised some good issues here.\\n\\nAnother problem (and this is common to all student essays) is that sometimes you lose track of what you're saying and your sentence doesn't make sense. This is hard to solve when typing but can be addressed by proofreading. Most people struggle to proofread their own text so you may want to enlist a friend or family member. Alternatively, a good trick is to proofread your own text backwards, paragraph by paragraph. this should allow you to think about each paragraph (starting with the last) and whether it all hangs together and makes sense on its own. Try it. I promise you'll be impressed with how helpful it can be.\\n\\nOverall, although you may be disappointed with the mark here, you're actually not far from a much higher one if you solve some of the more fiddly problems like referencing. So don't get disheartened.\"],[\"Christopher Mitchell\",42,-0.15,\"As a note, late penalties are applied automatically now but don't worry, I've added your name to a list so it will be removed. It's just because of the confusion over links. Your actual mark for this is 55.5.\"],[\"Christopher Mitchell\",177,0.3554258241758242,\"A good essay with some great points raised. Really good job on the research.\\n\\nOverall the structure here is good and you argument builds nicely. The text is a little unclear in the early paragraphs and I think you could do with a proofread just to make sure each sentence hangs together nicely.\\n\\nTo improve here, make sure you're developing your points fully. This can be difficult with limited word counts but it is a skill worth developing. For example, you raise some points that seem to just hang alone rather than connect to your central point. You mention vitamin A and leafcutter bees working close to the nest but don't explain why these points are important. For the very highest marks, you'll need to develop these ideas fully.\\n\\nI should add that the fourth paragraph does an excellent job of doing this. It is fully developed, brings in important evidence and makes a good argument. That should be a model for your writing in future. It's excellent.\\n\\nOverall, good work. Well done.\"],[\"Christopher Mitchell\",141,0.24242857142857144,\"A good essay with generally very good use of the literature. Well done.\\n\\nThe structure is a little odd but only minorly so, with some technical terms only being defined just under half-way through the text. It is usually best to be very clear about what you're discussing from as early as possible.\\n\\nSome points are under-developed, particularly when you discuss other modes of pollination. There is so much to elaborate on here. Could other animals cover for the honeybees? Could plants evolve or be manipulated by us and how much effort/money would that take? Could we just switch food sources? All these get touched upon in 1 or 2 sentences but could perhaps be paragraphs in their own right. For a short essay like this, a little more development would be ideal.\\n\\nOverall a very good essay. Well done.\"],[\"Christopher Mitchell\",56,-0.016666666666666663,\"Note that an automatic late penalty has been applied.

Ultimately this kind of thing is worth very few marks (1 or 2) in most cases but since it's easy, try enlisting a friend or relative to proofread. Alternatively, proofread your own text by reading each paragraph in isolation starting from the end of the essay and working back to the start. It can be a good way to analyze your own structure.\\n\\nThe points you raise here are well researched and well though out. you bring in good evidence for your major claims and it really helps support the arguments you make. I would say that your conclusion surprised me. I had gathered from your main text that you were very worried about drug resistance and would prefer other methods. This is usually a sign that your weighting is a little off and maybe you could have developed your concerns about insecticides more. For example the blanket use of insecticides can be dangerous to other ecosystem components and you don't really cover this.\\n\\nOverall, a good essay. You are a little verbose sometimes so try going back through your text and trying to ruthlessly cut out unneeded lines or words. You might be suprised how much space you can free up. Very well done.\"],[\"Christopher Mitchell\",217,0.26458333333333334,\"A good essay bringing in some excellent points and making a solid, consistent argument throughout. Your piece is well written and well researched.\\n\\nThere are a lot of references (which is good) but the sources are a little suspect. There are too many news and popular science sources here. You need to be focussing on primary literature.\\n\\nAs for your conclusion, I think there is a slight flaw in your argument (don't worry it doesn't cost you many marks but it's important to be aware). The reduction in bee population and diversity that you point to is something that doesn't happen in isolation. It is probably not the case that all the other bees and other pollinators can chip in and cover the gap because they too are subject to the forces that are threatening bees. You slightly miss the chance to set up this point despite your good focus on non-honeybee species. I think it might change your argument if you were to consider that honeybees going extinct might be a harbinger of a more general ecological decline or even collapse. Nevertheless, your point is soundly argued that honeybees alone aren't going to finish us off.\\n\\nOverall a good essay with a decent structure and a well argued case.
