# Welcome to Canvas Wizzards

This book is for anyone who needs to perform gritty, repetitive tasks in Canvas.
You might need to enrol many students on a course from a long list, build spreadsheets
that consolidate student grades, or create hundreds of assignments across multiple courses.
Performing these tasks using the Canvas (LMS) user interface is boring and slow.
You can harness the power of the Canvas Application Programming Interface (API), with 
a bit of Python, to complete these tasks in a fraction of the time it usually takes.
