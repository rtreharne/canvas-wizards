# What is an API?

An **application programming interface** (API) is a set of stored functions or procedures that allow you get, create or edit data from an application without having to use a graphical interface (e.g. a website). The Canvas API will allow you to do almost anything that you currently do using the standard user interface. 

The Canvas API is extremely well documented and, while the documentation may seem somewhat impenetrable at first, reading the docs can solve most problems. Check it out at <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/" target="_blank">https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/</a>.

*"So what?"* - I hear you say. Well, the power of the API lies with the ability to prepare snippets of code (we're going to use **Python** here) to make use of the API's functions in order to automate repetitive tasks and cut your workload dramatically.

*"OMG, I have to write code?"*. Well, yes. Get over it. It's really not that bad and this book is going to guide you all the way. Deep breath now, let's dive in.

# Getting Started

MyST stands for "Markedly Structured Text". It
is a slight variation on a flavor of markdown called "CommonMark" markdown,
with small syntax extensions to allow you to write **roles** and **directives**
in the Sphinx ecosystem.

For more about MyST, see [the MyST Markdown Overview](https://jupyterbook.org/content/myst.html).

## Sample Roles and Directives

Roles and directives are two of the most powerful tools in Jupyter Book. They
are kind of like functions, but written in a markup language. They both
serve a similar purpose, but **roles are written in one line**, whereas
**directives span many lines**. They both accept different kinds of inputs,
and what they do with those inputs depends on the specific role or directive
that is being called.

Here is a "note" directive:

```{note}
Here is a note
```

It will be rendered in a special box when you build your book.

Here is an inline directive to refer to a document: {doc}`markdown-notebooks`.


## Citations

You can also cite references that are stored in a `bibtex` file. For example,
the following syntax: `` {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014` `` will render like
this: {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014`.

Moreover, you can insert a bibliography into your page with this syntax:
The `{bibliography}` directive must be used for all the `{cite}` roles to
render properly.
For example, if the references for your book are stored in `references.bib`,
then the bibliography is inserted with:

```{bibliography}
```
