<h2>Description<a class="headerlink" href="#description" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This tool will perform an analysis of feedback on submissions for a given (or multiple) assignments.</p>
<p>A sentiment analysis is performed to determine sentiment score for each comment, i.e. a relative measure of how positive/negative the overall language in each comment is.</p>
<p>A <em>Feedback Rating</em> score for each comment is calculated as the product of comment length (number of words) and sentiment score.</p>

<section id="warning">
<h2>Warning<a class="headerlink" href="#warning" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>There is likely to be a high level of subjectivity in the sentiment analysis and a manual audit, to compare feedback comments and corresponding sentiment scores, should be made before drawing any conclusions from the data.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this analysis only looks at comments made in the “comments box” on Speedgrader. It does not consider in-line comments/annotations made directly on the submitted documents.</p>

There are some things that hold you back though.\n\nThe biggest and most obvious is referencing. In this case you have simply placed links in the text and this is not the format we accept. A proper scientific reference should be formatted in text as (Author Date). For example I would cite your essay using the following citation (Thatcher 2022) in text and then more complete details in the reference list. Furthermore, the sources you have chosen look like good sources for research but not for citing in an essay. The overwhelming majority of your references in an essay need to be primary literature sources like scientific papers or the occasional textbook.\n\nMore generally, you raise some very good points in this essay and approach the rather frightening claims made with a healthy sense of skepticism. This is very good. Keep that critical thinking active at all times when you're presented with a claim like this. What I would like to see for some of the higher marks is you fully developing these points. You could discuss these in some more detail. For example, your point about economic strife cause by bee extinction is good but you could go on to explain that civilisational struggle and even collapse is not quite extinction. You get close to this point but don't quite explain it. As a note this is hard with short word counts so you've still raised some good issues here.\n\nAnother problem (and this is common to all student essays) is that sometimes you lose track of what you're saying and your sentence doesn't make sense. This is hard to solve when typing but can be addressed by proofreading. Most people struggle to proofread their own text so you may want to enlist a friend or family member. Alternatively, a good trick is to proofread your own text backwards, paragraph by paragraph. this should allow you to think about each paragraph (starting with the last) and whether it all hangs together and makes sense on its own. Try it. I promise you'll be impressed with how helpful it can be.\n\nOverall, although you may be disappointed with the mark here, you're actually not far from a much higher one if you solve some of the more fiddly problems like referencing.

Without these statements, the text becomes a list of facts, from which the reader is supposed to draw their own conclusion, and that won't always be what you intend. Your conclusion is too long given the shortness of the essay altogether. You present a sound argument, and I like the way you show the importance of a third factor (epidemiological surveillance) to the success or failure of both treatment approaches. This shows criticial thinking, but you could make the point more forcefully, i.e. say that neither approach can be successful without understanding the epidemiological context. draw out the factors that make both solutions succeed or fail, like epidemiological surveillance.\n\nStructure: Sensible layout, but lack of joining sentences means that the progression of argument is haphazard - e.g. transition into Figure 1 discussion - how does this relate to the preceeding paragraph? The table is a good idea, but you need to write about it in the text.\n\nSupplementary: citations are thin generally, but good use of the DDT resistance study - for more marks explain how representative this is of the current situation.\n\nLanguage: put species names in Italics and give the full name on first use.\nGenerally, some redrafting was needed because some prose is awkward, e.g. \"There have been instances where insecticides have been known to not control the presence of malaria due to resistance, however, there is nothing to prove that this is the case and is thereby, still used as a controlling measure.\" Aside from the grammatical errors, its not clear why something that is 'known' is discarded as unproven."],["Marcus Blagrove",25,0.705,"very good content, but more discussion in the text would have improved it. instead of one-sided paragraphs, give alternatives and discuss as you go along."],["Jo Fothergill",146,0.33828125000000003,"Well done.

I may not agree with all the statements made, but they are made well and backed up with evidence. However, for a higher mark, I would want to see more consideration given to the opposing view. In this essay, you appeared to decide early on which side your views fell on, and the remainder of the essay provided (very well written) justification.

Your conclusion is too long given the shortness of the essay altogether. You present a sound argument, and I like the way you show the importance of a third factor (epidemiological surveillance) to the success or failure of both treatment approaches.

Mitchell",141,0.2666607142857143,"A very well written essay with lots of good information and a clear structure. Well done.\n\nAt times, although you use excellent sources, they are not always in the right places. A good rule of thumb is that whenever you are stating something like X% of crops are animal pollinated (ie there is a number involved) or a study was done to show, you should link the information to a citation. Sometimes you do exactly this and there's no problem but sometimes it is missing and becomes more noticeable by it's absence.\n\nOccasionally, you bring up a point (such as the economic costs of losing bees) and fail to develop it much further. For the very highest marks, you will need to fully develop these ideas and elaborate more on teh consequences.\n\nOverall a very good essay. Well done."],["Christopher Mitchell",405,0.26712121212121204,"A good attempt here and you've raised some really good points. There are some things that hold you back though.\n\nThe biggest and most obvious is referencing. In this case you have simply placed links in the text and this is not the format we accept. A proper scientific reference should be formatted in text as (Author Date). For example I would cite your essay using the following citation (Thatcher 2022) in text and then more complete details in the reference list. Furthermore, the sources you have chosen look like good sources for research but not for citing in an essay. The overwhelming majority of your references in an essay need to be primary literature sources like scientific papers or the occasional textbook.\n\nMore generally, you raise some very good points in this essay and approach the rather frightening claims made with a healthy sense of skepticism. This is very good. Keep that critical thinking active at all times when you're presented with a claim like this. What I would like to see for some of the higher marks is you fully developing these points. You could discuss these in some more detail. For example, your point about economic strife cause by bee extinction is good but you could go on to explain that civilisational struggle and even collapse is not quite extinction. You get close to this point but don't quite explain it. As a note this is hard with short word counts so you've still raised some good issues here.\n\nAnother problem (and this is common to all student essays) is that sometimes you lose track of what you're saying and your sentence doesn't make sense. This is hard to solve when typing but can be addressed by proofreading. Most people struggle to proofread their own text so you may want to enlist a friend or family member. Alternatively, a good trick is to proofread your own text backwards, paragraph by paragraph. this should allow you to think about each paragraph (starting with the last) and whether it all hangs together and makes sense on its own. Try it. I promise you'll be impressed with how helpful it can be.\n\nOverall, although you may be disappointed with the mark here, you're actually not far from a much higher one if you solve some of the more fiddly problems like referencing. So don't get disheartened."],["Christopher Mitchell",42,-0.15,"As a note, late penalties are applied automatically now but don't worry, I've added your name to a list so it will be removed.

Really good job on the research.\n\nOverall the structure here is good and you argument builds nicely. The text is a little unclear in the early paragraphs and I think you could do with a proofread just to make sure each sentence hangs together nicely.\n\nTo improve here, make sure you're developing your points fully. This can be difficult with limited word counts but it is a skill worth developing. For example, you raise some points that seem to just hang alone rather than connect to your central point. You mention vitamin A and leafcutter bees working close to the nest but don't explain why these points are important. For the very highest marks, you'll need to develop these ideas fully.\n\nI should add that the fourth paragraph does an excellent job of doing this. It is fully developed, brings in important evidence and makes a good argument. That should be a model for your writing in future. It's excellent.\n\nOverall, good work. Well done."],["Christopher Mitchell",141,0.24242857142857144,"A good essay with generally very good use of the literature. Well done.\n\nThe structure is a little odd but only minorly so, with some technical terms only being defined just under half-way through the text. It is usually best to be very clear about what you're discussing from as early as possible.\n\nSome points are under-developed, particularly when you discuss other modes of pollination. There is so much to elaborate on here. Could other animals cover for the honeybees? Could plants evolve or be manipulated by us and how much effort/money would that take? Could we just switch food sources? All these get touched upon in 1 or 2 sentences but could perhaps be paragraphs in their own right. For a short essay like this, a little more development would be ideal.\n\nOverall a very good essay. Well done."],["Christopher Mitchell",56,-0.016666666666666663,"Note that an automatic late penalty has been applied.

Ultimately this kind of thing is worth very few marks (1 or 2) in most cases but since it's easy, try enlisting a friend or relative to proofread. Alternatively, proofread your own text by reading each paragraph in isolation starting from the end of the essay and working back to the start. It can be a good way to analyze your own structure.\n\nThe points you raise here are well researched and well though out. you bring in good evidence for your major claims and it really helps support the arguments you make. I would say that your conclusion surprised me. I had gathered from your main text that you were very worried about drug resistance and would prefer other methods. This is usually a sign that your weighting is a little off and maybe you could have developed your concerns about insecticides more. For example the blanket use of insecticides can be dangerous to other ecosystem components and you don't really cover this.\n\nOverall, a good essay. You are a little verbose sometimes so try going back through your text and trying to ruthlessly cut out unneeded lines or words. You might be suprised how much space you can free up. Very well done."],["Christopher Mitchell",217,0.26458333333333334,"A good essay bringing in some excellent points and making a solid, consistent argument throughout. Your piece is well written and well researched.\n\nThere are a lot of references (which is good) but the sources are a little suspect. There are too many news and popular science sources here. You need to be focussing on primary literature.\n\nAs for your conclusion, I think there is a slight flaw in your argument (don't worry it doesn't cost you many marks but it's important to be aware). The reduction in bee population and diversity that you point to is something that doesn't happen in isolation. It is probably not the case that all the other bees and other pollinators can chip in and cover the gap because they too are subject to the forces that are threatening bees. You slightly miss the chance to set up this point despite your good focus on non-honeybee species. I think it might change your argument if you were to consider that honeybees going extinct might be a harbinger of a more general ecological decline or even collapse. Nevertheless, your point is soundly argued that honeybees alone aren't going to finish us off.\n\nOverall a good essay with a decent structure and a well argued case. Well done."]],"hovertemplate":"Feedback Rating (arb. units): %{y:.1f}<br>Grade (%): %{x}<br>Marker: %{customdata[0]}<br>Comment Length (words): %{customdata[1]}<br>Sentiment (arb. units): %{customdata[2]:.4f}","legendgroup":"Mitchell","marker":{"color":"#EF553B","opacity":0.8,"size":[141,405,42,177,141,56,228,217],"sizemode":"area","sizeref":1.065,"symbol":"circle"},"mode":"markers","name":"Mitchell","orientation":"v","showlegend":true,"x":[69.5,55.5,55.5,64.0,67.0,67.0,68.0,66.5],"xaxis":"x","y":[37.599160714285716,108.18409090909087,-6.3,62.91037087912088,34.182428571428574,-0.9333333333333331,35.292500000000004,57.41458333333333],"yaxis":"y","type":"scatter"},{"customdata":[["Robert Treharne",84,0.18263888888888888,"Luca, this essay could have been better.
